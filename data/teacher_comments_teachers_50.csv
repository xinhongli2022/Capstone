&amp;#x200B;

Basically.

&amp;#x200B;

Governments have statistics that are looked at and compared to other countries.  Organisations within governments identify problems and issues in the statistics and want to fix them to make them look better.  
Fixing problems requires funding, the amount of funding is dependent on how the problem is fixed, by determining which resources to use, and by the best way to build programs to address the problems.  
Governments don't want to spend money, and teachers are already paid for workers, thus, many problems that can be related to teachers are allocated to teachers.  This is done in several ways, but one of the most common processes is as follows:

Identify the problem.  In this case, because I have studied it, we will look at Wellbeing.

Mental health statisitics for young people have been constantly becoming worse and worse over the last few decades.  More depression, more anxiety, more stress, more special needs, more psychological issues and, BAM, lower test scores, lower high school attainment, lower literacy, etc, etc, etc.  Oh, and people are dying.

Psychologists, psychiatrists and hospitals would be the appropriate response, but the human resource numbers are low and spread out, and  it is incredibly expensive.

The government decides that the best way to affect the mental health of youth is through schools, after all, teachers spend a lot of time with students and so it seems a good fit to be able to provide these services to children through their educational institutions.

So, more counselors and school psychologists, then.  No.  Too expensive.

What the government does is it contracts out research grants to its favoured organisations in order to research and find evidence that teachers caring about their students mental health and engaging in activities that foster belonging and acceptance as well as understanding mental health are of benefit.  In Australia, this is generally Catholic Schooling (which, as can be expected of a private educational organisation, doesn't have that many mentally unwell students, or SEN, or problematic behaviours)  Those researchers (rather specific schools) then conduct research using a specified program, and lo and behold they find evidence that this is the case (because, of course it is).  This is then published by a University with close ties to the Catholic education system, if not a Catholic university itself, and the research is repeated elsewhere and a preponderance of supporting evidence is collected.

There is a network of organisations that work towards similar things.  With this research, one organisation creates a program (based on the original research program) that can be used in schools.  This program is evidence-based.  This program is then trialed (in Catholic schools) and the results seem to be beneficial.

The government then says ""Hey, look. we were right, schools can solve the problem of the mental health crisis"".  Thanking the Catholic organisation for their work, they then buy the program and start providing it to all their public schools, and say it needs to be implemented.

Meanwhile, other related organisations review the program and say it's good.  Others are now jumping on board for the grant money, outside of the preferred organisation.  Public universities are supporting it because the evidence is there (because of course it is) and it becomes an academic argument, rather than one based on whether or not teachers should be responsible for the mental health of their students.

The government then pay for professional development seminars that discuss the program and its importance for the mental health of students in schools.  It becomes required for teachers to incorporate it into their class time.  There are directives written and outcomes expected.

Universities then start to include this new academic area of research and discussion under a new term ""Wellbeing"".  Books are being written, lessons are being made, techniques are being drafted, all are being sold.  People are making money, and finding more and more research and more and more evidence of the need for Wellbeing because mental health outcomes in youth are still dropping.  We need more work from teachers to solve this crisis.  It is their duty.

Meanwhile, teachers are scrambling trying to fit in the extra program and read up about the research and understand what they need to do.  They feel pressured and stressed about it and they feel responsible and guilty for poor mental health in students.  But it's what you do.  You do it for deez keeds.

""Wellbeing"" now becomes a part of school culture.  It affects how students can behave, how behaviour is addressed, it explains behaviour, it's a lack of wellbeing that's doing it, not a lack of professional help.  The teacher is not serious in their responsibility to the wellbeing of their students, they need help, they only lash out and destroy the classroom because they don't feel accepted, they need to build a relationship with you, they should never feel ashamed, how dare you!

Kids are not stupid.  They take advantage.  They act up and get sent to the 'mindfulness' room, where they get to sit and play with toys, or Ipads, or they get to sleep, and they end up with a treat or a reward.  Their mental health is improving, well, the symptoms are improving.

Meanwhile, the government makes a statement that they are addressing youth mental health with a new academically acclaimed program in schools, designed to foster social and emotional learning and skills, that will help students learn to tackle the stressors of life in a blossoming economy.

It will fail, of course, eventually.  The stats will still decrease, but what matters is that the government acted and was seen to have acted.  Meanwhile, the Catholic Schools abandoned this program and way of thinking a long time ago, and, because its a private organisation, it doesn't have to follow the governments decree that all schools have to have such a program.  They've gone back to pastoral care, and strict discipline.

73,i4mg2qu,t1_i4ljuja,t3_u2uk1w,Atolic,Teachers,"&gt;This is why we need teacher-supporting parents.

This can be hard for some people. Specifically speaking for myself, I was raised with shitty teachers. The ones that don't give a shit and run you into the ground.

You know those uplifting stories about teachers taking kids under their wing, helping and supporting them, encouraging their confidence? That shit is all fairy tails to me. 

Teachers routinely belittled me throughout middle and high school. 

I got punched in the back walking away from a aggressive kid in the hallway between classes. He came back for another punch so I pushed him away from me to defend myself and got suspended for a week for ""fighting"". 

My guidance counselor thought it was a ""good idea and plan"" to drop out and get a minimum wage job. Fully supportive of that position!

What state did I receive this stellar education? Where else but Florida. I try hard not to apply my biases to educators now that I have kids of my own; there are some good ones out there, but there are a lot of bad ones too. Not bad like, ""Teacher touched your kid inappropriately"" but bad like ""I really don't give a shit about any of these kids or my job and do the absolutely bear minimum to collect my paycheck"". Bad like my kid has speech delay and needs more help but the school wants to say it's ""improved"" because of their one hour a week therapy. Administrators don't want to change anything and teachers are just as complicit. Checking the box ""improved"" makes them look good. 

The only ""change"" seems to happen is when the right leaning morons unite to ban books or demagogue the gays or hide racism and the left leaning morons unite for ""trophies for all"" and passing ""A"" grade for participation because little Jimmy gets depressed if he gets anything less. Common sense and good faith seem to be in short supply these days and teachers, by and large, haven't done much to restore my confidence in the system as a whole. I can't ""ask"" for a ""good"" teacher.",1649887452

Some examples may include organized games such as beanbag toss, hula hoops, sidewalk chalk, hop scotch, etc. Games such as Red Light/Green Light, racing, etc. should not be allowed.

1) Take a look if there are any reviews in Glassdoor and Indeed about what it’s like working there. I’ve found some reviews about a revolving door in admin and after school obligations that have made me not apply.

2) Take a look at their websites and see what kinds of curriculums they use and what they offer as their focus. If a school prioritizes SEL and you’re not a fan of that, don’t apply. If they are a Montessori school and you don’t like that, don’t apply. You can also get an idea about after school activities (which can ask if teachers are obligated to run, if you’re interviewed).

3) Look up parent reviews about the school. I’ve run across some reviews that praise the elementary level but did not like middle school admin. I’ve read other reviews about holes in the curriculum.

It is not helpful to convince children that they are failures and that they cannot succeed as they are. 

Yes behavior must be modified when it’s maladaptive but I doubt you have the credentials to make that clinical judgement. 

Those students certainly faced challenges that you are not aware of. And they succeeded by progressing through life. You don’t get to chose for them what that success is and how it looks and you certainly don’t get to choose which of their successes should be celebrated and which should not. 

Moving onto high school is a mile stone for them. No matter how minor it is for us. Encouragement will always have greater odds of producing a positive impact than the approach your describing.

8,i4lwuz6,t1_i4lt5bz,t3_u2sote,dawgsheet,Teachers,"The expenditure per student for my local school (not the one i specifically teach at) is 11k. Dallas ISD is &gt;14k. That's approx a 30% increase in per pupil funding. 

According to the 10000 websites that calculate and compare COL between cities, Dallas has a 20%ish higher cost of living than this city. So per child expenditures accounting for COL is still higher in Urban areas.

The recapture law is **fantastic**, because it allows teachers in rural areas to be paid decently enough to make it make sense to teach, which gives (often poor) rural kids a chance in life if they don't want to work on their family's ranch. 

I don't believe that we should let poor rural kids not have a quality education because they were born to a poor family, born out in the country, etc. I think everyone should have a good education, which is what that law does.

All this data is public : Dallas has approx a 1:14 staff to student ratio. Local district has approx a 1:15.5

It *truly* evens the playing field. Teachers are getting paid similarly when accounting for COL all across Texas, with rural areas getting paid a tiny bit less. There's a similar staff to student ratio across Texas. With urban areas having a slightly better ratio.

Now if 30% higher per pupil funding isn't enough, while COL is 20% higher - how much better do you think Urban teachers should be paid than rural teachers to make it fair? Because even after accounting for COL, rural schools are still funded about 10% less.

Now if you're not adequately staffed, it has nothing to do with funding - it has to do with the funds being squandered/wasted by those in charge. The numbers after COL adjustments line up for Dallas being at least 10% more funded than local district and somehow only have 1 admin per 600+ students.",1649879740
9,i4lwuji,t3_u2xivb,t3_u2xivb,SpiritedAwayToo,Teachers,"I appreciate you and anyone willing to step up to sub. Subs have been holding schools together during covid and they do it for crappy pay. They often sign up for one job but then are reassigned onsite to random jobs...often ones that the rest of us don't enjoy. Honest to God, I appreciate people like you. I'm a specials teacher and people like me often feel like we fall outside the lines because grade level teams are tight and so we are the random teachers. I see you and what you're doing. 

I will talk to anyone and, sometimes, I get a look of surprise from a sub or an assistant because I asked how their day was or I introduced myself. This makes me sad. I learn everyone's name and, honestly, it means those people smile at me or they pop by to quickly say hello. That makes me feel good too and so it kind of spreads some positivity around. It's good for everyone. 

Because I talk to subs, when I really get to know the regulars,  they often tell me that they feel like you and I think...if they just walked, we would all be screwed. I don't know if people realize how close to the edge we live when we don't speak to subs like equals. I mean, being kind is its own reward but it's a case of losing critical help when we desperately need it.

The same is true of take home assignments. There is a set amount of assignments for a course in a given year, assigned at a certain rate. If the extra time exceeds that rate, then the student will not be able to finish all the assignments before the end of the term. So you either have to cut assignments or give them time after the term. 

That’s really the rub with these things. That even though it is billed as supporting the student, what it is really doing is removing tasks. The whole idea behind most special ed is to provide additional inputs to the students so that they can grow. But accommodations as we commonly see them aren’t doing that. There is no additional input, merely a relaxation of our output needs. That isnt serving the student, because now they have the appearance of supports, but nothing substantive to help them grow, just things preventing them from failing. Could be worse, but so far from acceptable, and it is a flaw inherent in our current special Ed model.

What you have described violates both state and federal laws. As they accessed your school account, that may also involve violations committed on state-supported property (US-centric).

You indicate this may also have exposed personal information on your partner. You did not indicate whether or not your partner has experienced any additional contact attempts or abuse.

From all of the above, this is no longer solely a school matter.  And, there is another private citizen who deserves protection.

Nothing in this email is intended to tell you what you should do, about this matter or anything else. All I can tell you is what I'd do. And all of the below is still subject to changes brought about by further information and reactions of the other people involved.

If I had a lawyer, I'd probably contact them first. If I was a member of a union, I'd consult them as well.  I'd then notify the administration, in writing, via my school email account, and also cc'd to a new, outside email address, that I was notifying law enforcement, and that they should please take the appropriate steps to ensure that all digital records of successful access attempts, failed access attempts and any communications related to this event and that student, for the relevant dates and going forward until the matter is resolved, are kept secure and confidential, in accordance with state and federal laws.  

IF the student is a minor, the school might want to consider notifying that student's parent or legal guardian. They might also want to review the district's relevant acceptable use and student discipline policies, in order to protect the district,  staff, and students.

You should probably also get familiar with DMCA takedowns and reporting violations due to cyber abuse.

The big take away for me was teaching multiple methods for the same end. Some ways seemed complex and unrealistic to execute. However, I do buy the idea that using things like 10s groups, bonds, etc help develop number sense, also that some students will gravitate toward a specific method. 

I had a hard time with math as a student, I had a few concepts that I understood well and would apply them anywhere I could. For example, factoring has simply never been something that I can ""see"" as fluently as some people. Some people just intuitively figure factoring out, or need very few guesses. 

I liked the quadratic formula, because, despite being a lot of work, I could reliably make it work. Graphing calculators take this to a much greater extreme. 

I now teach HS. SO many kids demand to know ""how to do this type"", ""what is the answer?!"". They want to know what numbers to cram into their calculator. Very little number sense, which is probably more practically important to everyday people. Crazy answers to word problems go unchallenged, siblings are hundreds of years old, rent is $20, whatever.

And dude, I’m a GOVERNMENT teacher, trust me I know the line of when to bring personal politics into your classroom. But pretending that you aren’t politicized because you think you are apolitical is missing my point.

My job is not inherently political. Sure, there are ""politics"" at every university or school, but it's not part of our jobs to promote either republican or democratic politics. It's better to be apolitical. That being said, we should vote for the candidates that we think will do the best job and participate in the electoral process as participating citizens.

What I really mean is not to eliminate an appropriate discussion of politics from actual course content (both sides of issues need to be covered). But I don't considered giving students supplies like pencils to be a political act, nor is how we dress (as long as you're not wearing red caps or buttons or t-shirts that endorse one political party over another). Bumper stickers on cars are fine, but promoting one party over the other in class is not acceptable.

For tests, I always gave out 3 answers for MC. The students could ask me anything during the test, and if it was something I didn't think the class would understand, I explained it a little. 

For papers, there is a lot of talking. I would break papers into parts and we would have regular one-on-one disccusions.

Don't say more than you have to.

A lot of decent teachers have an instinct to try to build consensus and work *with* parents... and that's great, to a point. Unfortunately, consensus building only works with people who are also trying to bridge the gap - it doesn't work with bad actors. I like to give people the benefit of the doubt, but when I'm dealing with a bad actor parent, they are going to twist everything I say or use it as a reason to get angrier with me.

Don't give them the ammunition. Communicate as little as you can until the parent has shown you what kind of person they are, then you know how open you can be with them.",1649873109

Here’s my advice:
(1) Find out whether you receive any compensation for the gig. Stipend? Extra prep time? Even at a small school, it’s a lot of work. 
(2) Find out whether you get any budget to help out with things like cameras or trainings for students. Also find out the current financial status of the publication. Is it breaking even or running a deficit. 
(3) How many students would you have on staff? Do they choose the class or is it a dumping ground?
(4) Join JEA and get a mentor. Through the mentorship program, you get two years free, someone else to talk to and access to a full journalism curriculum. (Shameless plug, I am a mentor so you can DM me for more details.)",1649873098

The supervising teacher then ends up in a time crunch submitting pages to the publisher and checking the proofs, and the work takes hours.

Make a master list of page layouts and set firm deadlines for when they must be complete for inclusion. For example, the two-page spread for the winter concert gets completed by the second week in January, or it won’t be in the final yearbook; fall sports and club pages are done by Nov. 1, etc. Based on your conversations with the publisher, set deadlines for non-layout tasks too—sales targets by date, submitting order forms, uploading images to the publisher, checking proofs, distributing books. Then assign responsibility for follow-through to one or two students per task. The entire time you need to communicate that you will not be the person to make sure printing happens, and the students are responsible for making sure the whole project doesn’t get scrapped due to being late.",1649871518

The vast majority of adults are super math illiterate and very resistant to change. They are also unable to see the bigger picture. The whole point is to teach strategies to eventually do advanced math in your head without needing a calculator or scrap paper. In the beginning stages, it does seem to tremendously over complicate simple problems but this is where you are first taught to break down numbers in ways that make more complicated calculations easier in future lessons. It’s quite brilliant, actually. Many parents just see the complicated break down of simple problems and wonder why they don’t “just do the problem” without all the extra steps. “Why make it harder,” they say while not understanding how the process will be applied in more advanced math classes in the future. They just dig their heels in and taint their kids against the “new math.” 

It is a sad state of affairs to see adults on social media posts vehemently defending their incorrect answers to basic problems requiring the order of operations blaming it on “the new math” and iTs NoT hOw tHeY wErE tAuGhT. I guess to them “new math” means math techniques from the 16th and 17th centuries? The teaching of math has horrifically failed past generations and we have made a large populace  who actively fear math and then in turn, pass this math ineptitude on to their children/students. Somewhere along the line, it became acceptable to admit “I’m stupid with math.” It’s worn like a badge of honor and is actually quite pathetic. I spent many years in my adult life thinking I was a math idiot but it turns out I am very good at it. Who would have thought weekly standardized math tests (late 80s to 90s called either SIMS or CIMS tests in NY state) were a horrid way to “teach” math?

I’m currently getting credentialed. I’m planning on designing my math class (they need math teachers) like my coding class where you just fix errors. Or that will be the majority of the grade. 

Hypothetical student got X problem wrong. Here is their steps. Find where it went wrong. I’m going to hammer steps. 

But I’m not seeing how common core prepares kids better for more advanced math. I can’t find any resources on it. 

Like in coding you grind the steps. But at the end you can apply what you learned to something physical. 

I get the defensiveness of the subjects we teach because of our emotional attachment, but I objectively cannot see how common core facilitates better understanding down the road. 

During lock down I had to help my own kids. I have no idea how this common core stuff helps compared to how I ground it out. Even the teachers were like: grind the times tables. Off the cuff I modeled multiplication after how you figure density with mass and volume. You can find the missing number if you know 2 numbers. So a triangle. 56 at the top and 7 and 8 on the bottom ends. If you know 56 and 7, what’s missing?  Multiplication and division all at once. It worked. My kid caught on quick. But then to jump back in the class and call not being able to do the common core steps isn’t “learning loss”. It’s “learning as we want you to loss”.",1649869546

&gt;I’d say that falls within the CRT framework,

Well you'd be wrong because these ideas still don't exist within any core academic CRT texts. You can't just ascribe any ideas or arguments surrounding race to CRT because some authors support certain organizations or other authors. I wanted to give you the benefit of the doubt and not assume you were a typical conservative who believed CRT includes any and all the most outrageous accusations toward white people or claims about race.

87,i4l663u,t3_u2szkg,t3_u2szkg,GooseCaboose,Teachers,"Former teacher here, but happy to share my insight into the profession:

1. I did, for the most part, but not enough to put my family in financial strain. Lots of positives with teaching, but I found that the stress and low pay was too much of a deterrent. 

2. Different schools have asked for different times. I also like getting in early to make sure I'm ready for the day. For the last school I was at, I would often arrive around 7:15am and our class day started at 8:00am I believe. 

3. I was a 7th year teacher with a masters degree earning $53k. For reference, the first job I had post-teaching when I made a career change jumped me to $90k + bonus. 

4. For high school, I highly recommend having a degree in the content area you're interested in and minoring in education or doing a grad program in education right after. I think having an actual degree in your content area allows for more options should you want to do something else later in life (compared to a degree in education, which can sometimes be limiting). 

5. Our day ended at 3:30, I was usually out by 4:30. Partly to do work, partly because I would chat with other teachers. But then I would often need to work at home to get ready for the next day. (I know some teachers are good at not doing this, and maybe I would have gotten better at this eventually, but it was always hard for me to do.)

6. It's a very rewarding job that is terribly unsupported and asks a lot of the people who support it for very little in return. If I had a rich spouse, then maybe I'd consider it again. But otherwise it doesn't seem worth it to my family to have less of me just so I can teach.

I also did the same thing as you and offered a “the students are working on developing collaborative and important classroom behaviors and skills, here’s how you can support with discussions at home.” All of these gave me some reallll easy parent meeting scripts and admin support platforms. A documented need for intervention for academic development is pretty defensible lol. Also, I would (when I was allowed) keep them for a few extra minutes of lunch bc they took their learning time for their own needs, so I’d take some of their time to makeup their classroom responsibilities, (I’m very pro-recess so I very very rarely did this and it depended on the grade).

Also, to clarify, if it was a specific student, (specifically a ring leader, class clown, or student with an IEP/504, home life sitch that I know about, or honestly anyone who is disruptive) after the first note home, I would pull them for a “hallway conference” or a door-open after class talk and just straight up be like “what’s going on? This isn’t like you. [even if it was like them lol] Is everything ok outside of school? Are you bored and need a walk or need some help understanding?” Or a “‘it’s great that our class thinks you’re funny. You should definitely keep learning how to interact with them, but right now it’s not the time to that skill. Let me know if you need some help figuring out what looks like”

Obviously modify for the kid sitch. Kids get escalation when they’re backed up with action and parent communication. Also backing it up with good day emails was helpful for my sanity. Full class emails were a super useful tool lol. Also having at least one coworker that you can scream into the void with a few times a week.",1649868867

53,i4l3wsk,t3_u2ucau,t3_u2ucau,GooseCaboose,Teachers,"What you're describing actually sounds a lot like the card game Mao I used to play as a kid. The gist of Mao is that there are some established rules (I can't remember what they are, but you could probably look them up online) but *no one* is allowed to share what the rules are. You have to just figure it out as you play. (An example of what the rules are like would be ""Whenever you play a seven you have to say 'Kevin'."" Originally kids who don't know the rule will make the mistake of not saying ""Kevin"" but over time they're connect the dots and internalize it as a rule.) Then, whoever wins a round gets to make a new rule that only they know and the others have to figure it out. 

It's a lot of fun and seems like it'd hit on this idea of ""Look, even without me explicit telling you, you'll figure this out. We've got brains for a reason!""

Alternatively, as a math teacher I used to do some activities where I would introduce simple games to kids and challenge them to play me (and they'd originally always lose because it'd be the type of game where whoever goes first wins if they adhere to a simple strategy) and then I'd have them play against each other 10 times keeping track of who won and lost and at the end offer a challenge to anyone again.

I understand that people are bad with maths. I understand that people learn things differently and that maths in particular can be very challenging because often, you don't have a possibility for a ""hands on"" approach like in physics or languages. But the stuff you learn in school is not complicated. If you don't go into A-levels calculus or similar topics (idk how school systems work around the world), a parent _should_ be able to at least understand it themselves for the most part. I can understand that a parent isn't capable of teaching it to their child, i also understand that there are exceptions, or parents who are just... Not intelligent or something else, but being so utterly defeated by middle school maths is kinda weird...

Also parents are so prone to underestimate their children the same way they overestimate them. For every parent who thinks their child is the next heisenberg or einstein, there's one who thinks their child is to dumb to calculate 10+10.",1649868482

Frankly, you've demonstrated a very confused understanding of CRT and therefore I don't believe you that it's being taught in your, or nearby schools, because you're incapable of defining it correctly.

It becomes extremely difficult for history and english teachers to do their job when people accuse any discussion of racial history and long term outcomes of being politically motivated and ideologically biased.

In my experience, if you can get to a human, a lot of people still have tremendous respect for teaching. Especially if they are proud of having a degree, themselves (a little confirmation bias).

That said, when you have a reason that you feel is compelling to leave early when you have a sixth period planning, it is fine to take it to the admin to ask. They are human, most of the time, so asking when you have a good reason is fine. ""Hey, the kids really ran me through the wringer today and I am about to fall asleep this last hour. Room is clean and note is written. Would you be okay with me leaving early?"" In this short-sub world, being a substitute friendly school is definitely something they should be doing their best to be. 

Recently I did just that. I asked if I could go home during a sixth period plan because the day had been awful (he had been in twice, and I don't remember the last time I had to call someone into my classroom for a naughty student) and I had been without hot water for a week of what I know now would be three weeks. The plumber was meeting with my husband at home during that sixth period to discuss replacement options. I asked to go home for that meeting and told him we were at the end of a week with no hot water. He said ""oh dear lord. We live in a first world country. You should definitely to deal with that. Thanks for everything today and please come back another time. Go home!"" 

I went back two weeks later and we had a great time. 

I also did it for nine weeks when I was finishing an endorsement at the college whose campus was down in South King county and I live on the other side of the City of Seattle to the north. To say traffic got ugly fast in the afternoon is an understatement. I told all the office managers and admins that I was doing three classes that term, and it was my last term, at this campus. They started at 4:30. Teacher dismissal for the middle schools is at 3. I told the office managers and admins that for the next nine weeks, on three days of the week, allowing me to leave as soon as the kids did was going to translate into being on time to these classes I was attending to get my new teaching endorsement. Ten minutes on the north end where I lived translated into forty fewer minutes of drive time.

The professor for two of them was a notorious stickler for being on time, and not at all flexible in that expectation. I was the only in-service teacher in the group, and I told him my predicament, and that if I am late to class it is not a matter of poor planning, but one of literally not being able to leave school before 3, resulting in not being able to make it to class by 4:30, and I hope he would understand as being an in service teacher in an education class should hold a little bit of sway. 

He was not happy at the heads-up, and took it as disrespect, but I didn't really care. It was a notification not a request for permission. I had to earn a living, and I was actually teaching, unlike anyone else in that room. 

Thankfully, I my admins and office managers were all in my corner and shooed me out of the building as soon as the kids were gone. I was only late once, and it was because I had excessive paperwork after school. The professor gave me a disapproving glare and I explained during our break. I still don't understand his refusal to accommodate an in-service teacher who was otherwise punctual. 

On the flip side, I have heard of teachers dismissing their classes early for the day and attempting to to home before the last student bell even rings. No joke. At that same school, I will reward a class that has been particularly great with a walk, all together, at the end of the school day, right to the edge of campus where they go down the stairs to the bus stop. 

This campus relies on the public buses and had a bus that arrives within five minutes of dismissal. That bus is a coveted bus to get in for them. I still stayed until the bell with the kids at the top of those stairs. I had them use the restroom on the way and so they had done everything they needed to do before we got there. What is better? None of them bolted on me because they knew I would just refuse to do it for that class anymore and nobody wanted to lose the privilege.",1649865874

1. I enjoy my job, but it's been hard to figure out how to enjoy it. It's the kind of job where it can get to you if you let it. I had to learn to let go of my expectations and focus on the kids in the classroom: are they having a good educational experience? Are they learning? Those two are enough for me.
2. I arrive to work at 7:00 am
3. $119k!? I'm moving to Canada! (I make roughly $60k after 11 years experience)
4. Whether you need it or not, I think it's a REALLY good idea to get a Master's in your field while you're teaching. NOT a Master's of Education, but a degree in the discipline you teach. It's enormously helpful to master your content, and the professors are good models for your own teaching.
5. I leave when the bell rings. I used to stay late, hoping to eventually become efficient enough not to stay late or take work home, but then I realized I just have to draw that red line. I take no work home, and my family really appreciates it. Even your first year, it's possible to stick to contract hours. You have to set your own boundaries though.
6. Yes. It's worth it, but that's a deeply personal conversation we each have with ourselves. Many teachers are leaving this year because they don't think it's worth it anymore. I plan to teach until I can't anymore...
7. You'll always have a teaching job if you go with Special Ed or STEM, but I find the teacher shortage puts ALL positions in demand.

To be honest, school is just a chore. I don't go to school cause I want to have fun or to be challenged, I'm just there cause I have to be.

I would much prefer a lecture where I sit and take notes rather than listen to a teacher explain instructions for 5 minutes, worry about who to choose to be in my group, and do work while half the people slack off anyway. It also doesn't help if that activity requires a presentation of some kind cause then the students would then prioritize and become anxious about presenting rather than quality of the work and learning. I like lectures and classes who use them often cause I would then know what to expect everyday. Lectures can be engaging too, but it mostly depends on the teacher and subject.

To make an analogy, I don't make student memorize dates anymore, because... well they would never in a million years need to know that 1066 was the date of the battle of Hastings.  But we do require them to identify cause and effect, and be able to identify patterns.

It is my 8th year teaching and the way I teach math to my students is drastically different from what I learned in school 20 years ago. To be frank, most parents do not like it and make it known. I also have many parents who dismiss their child when they show them the way they are learning math. It can be difficult because the kids are hearing one thing in school and another at home. 

I will say, there are parts that I do really like. We spend more time on the why and not just teaching a procedure to teach the procedure. There are parts that just don't seem to work and I don't necessarily agree with, like needing to memorize multiplication facts. My group this year does not know them and cannot even skip count. It makes me teaching fourth grade standards very difficult. I wish they were made to memorize them like I had to in school. I understand why math has developed over the years, but I think there needs to be a balance. 

At one point I read something that said that so many adults complain they never liked math and never got it because they never got the why it works. That stood out to me and helped me rationalize why I was teaching some of the things I was. We need to change the mindset about math. I do think parents need more resources to see the changes and how they can benefit students in the long run. However, I also think education needs to see if all of these ""newer"" ways are actually making a difference in the long wrong and if it's not, see what we can do to adjust.",1649864832

For example, facebook had a security vulnerability around the time of my first year teaching which allowed completely privatized/maximally secure facebook accounts to nevertheless be ""hacked"" by doing some very particular URL witchery that allowed you to potentially get access to a random photo album on that user's profile. Some of my students tried this exploit on me and found a photo album of a time I went to an arboretum with a friend and her little sister a few years prior.

Hi.  My wife is a first year teacher, so the parents are seeing what they can get away with on her.  One of the things I've had to train her on is to assert her rights as a teacher and professional.  Once parents learn that you can't be pushed around, they don't try it.

The first thing you need to get out of your head is the idea of parent as client.  Parents aren't your client.  Parents are legally required to send kids to school, because society decided long ago that we don't want a country full of stupid people.  So, society is your client.  Stop treating parents as your client and things get easier.

As to verbal abuse, I don't take it.  They don't get to do that.  If in a one-on-one, I end the meeting and encourage them to either communicate by email or to set up an appointment with admin.

If they do it while we're with admit, I leave the room.

My gut reaction is you should stay out of it. Consult with the student and parents all you want... but having teachers blur professional and personal lines is part of how we ended up where we are.


It's not your kid.


Consider that specific teacher. Clearly an older dude. Apparently sucks at the internet and is kinda fine with sucking at the internet. I'd be willing to bet that he's new to the technology... which means he's new to the culture... literally illiterate in the medium.

And very likely, he's a tool. Sure.

Do you want him punished or do you want the problem solved?

If you want the teacher punished, just set him on fire in social media. 

On solving the problem:
Some kid in that class can be the Secretary and curate the pics. It is likely that some kid does that for themselves currently... I always have a few students with serious organizational skills and interests, and make every legitimate effort to put those skills into play. The classroom teacher is missing a solution there.

As for the 'Think of the underprivileged kids that can't figure out PDFs and naming conventions'  

That is a douchebag move. It projects too perfectly his failure to learn how to use the basic tools of his profession. He can't get it to PDF so he makes that a format that would be a problem for the user, and lets him off the hook. But mostly the poor ones get hurt. They are the real victims if I learn how to 'save as...' 'rename' 

You don't hate poor children, do you?

 It's specious bullshit and poorly disguised classism.

I'd help my brother set up a quick system to save to PDF with teacher/date in the title and roll on down the road.

That teacher isn't going to change the posted docs thing this year... it's mid-April... nothing remotely class management is going to change this year. And he's used that argument before... it's language (if not logic) is too refined to be spontaneous from a dude that uses all caps. So it works for him.

There's no win here. Pick no battle here.

I am the old grumpy dude that understands tech that gets asked to teach Mr. AllCaps about not replying to all (again).  And blue underlined stuff links to other stuff. Don't get me started. He's more than kind of a dick.

As always, we remain mandated reporters, so maintain your standards.  

Also- I could be wrong. In a few or a lot of ways. It speaks to your legitimate concern that you are asking opinions before taking action.

It's still the same math -- I mean, it's math. Math doesn't really change when it comes to the fundamentals. But the instructional methods *did* confuse me at times because it's different to how I learned.

That said, it mostly just required me to spend a little time reviewing her homework problems/instructions and have her explain what she could recall of the in-class instruction and I could work it out for myself. Usually I would just reinforce what she was being taught once I understood the perspective, but occasionally I would show her how I had been taught, explaining that it's just different ways of accomplishing the same goal -- so while she needed to learn how she was being taught to do it, ultimately everyone settles on their own mental process once they comprehend *why* math operations are being done (the biggest bugbear of course being math involving fractions).

I'm not sure the point of your second paragraph. It just seems like a ploy set to hold teachers responsible for not ""fixing"" the issues that child had. We are not miracle workers and cannot undo much of the trauma, bad habits and attitude issues that students come into school with. The fact you seem to think that placing responsibility without outright blaming teachers makes it OK is one of the many problems with the perception of educators today. We are not given the tools or power to be able to hold kids accountable, yet we are rated on and expected to not just hold kids accountable, but to somehow make these drastic changes in their behavior in the short amount of time we have them while having 0 supports or ability to hold the students themselves responsible.

I don't laugh at people who pick goofy majors because certain things shouldn't be learned. I laugh at them because picking a major (or a grad program) isn't about learning. Why would it be? It's about making money. If you want to understand a subject, go read a book. Otherwise, you're paying thousands of dollars for something, so when/where is the ROI?

In my state, public school teachers will be at about $60k midcareer and admins start at 75k generally...so paying $20k to get a master's in educational leadership makes sense, because you're making that money back in just over a year (once you get the promotion, anyhow). 

But merely getting a master's degree and remaining a teacher does nothing but add $1-2k to your paycheck yearly. So if you go for the M.Ed and remain in the classroom, you make your money back in ten to twenty years. Is that worth it? Not for me, it isn't.

Also, your altruism is truly admirable. But I think too many teachers get caught up in an attitude that teaching contains an altruism that isn't found elsewhere. It's what admins are trying to inculcate when they pull us into staff meetings and talk about us being rockstars. It's what teachers do to themselves when they say they'd do something else, but they'd feel no purpose working in some soulless corporation.

I don't often go off about propaganda, but that's what that shit is. It's propaganda created so teachers stay in a thankless, underpaid profession. Immeasurable value is added to mankind by countless people in innumerable professions every day. And most of them are compensated in a much more generous manner.

28,i4kec7d,t3_u2qbwi,t3_u2qbwi,Loud_Internet572,Teachers,"I quit teaching back in November, so I may be a bit biased. In my mind, getting a master's in education is a waste of money and I stress that's my opinion. The pay off in income isn't going to match the financial costs of earning the degree (not to mention the cost in sweat, blood, tears, time studying, etc.). If getting a master's in another area would lead to a better career option, then I think it could be beneficial - it all depends. 

I moved into social work after leaving education and the money isn't as good, but I can work from home, make my own hours, etc. and that more than makes up for the money I lost. Counseling will also usually require a degree in psychology and a master's degree is always favorably looked upon (even though money might still not be there). If you are talking about a counselor in the school system, it usually requires a master's degree as well (in my experience anyway), so that could be a benefit to getting the advance degree, but I still don't think the payoff is going to be there. 

If you are happy teaching, I'd say stick that out and not invest the money and time in a master's degree unless you want to get into counseling so that you can get out of the classroom.

55,i4kdbnr,t3_u2q516,t3_u2q516,Loud_Internet572,Teachers,"Based on my experiences as a sped teacher and my own research into the issue, I'm not sure if there is a limit. It's all governed by the IDEA which is federal law, but I too have questioned this numerous times. For example, I've always said that I am in favor of having sped kids being separated onto their own campuses which can cater to their specific needs without being on a standard campus. They are still getting a FAPE and, to me at least, it's still LRE and they will still be with their peers. 

Now with that being said, I think there is a definite difference between the IDEA/504 as it applies to education and someone being denied an accommodation under the ADA. The ADA gives protections against discrimination for people with disabilities as it applies to their jobs, transportation, communication, etc. IDEA and 504 says you have to give disabled children accommodations so that they can succeed in school. 504 specifically says \[""no qualified individual with a disability in the United States shall be excluded from, denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under"" any program or activity that either receives Federal financial assistance or is conducted by any Executive agency or the United States Postal Service\] which covers schools since they get federal money.

So in my mind, someone requiring a particular accommodation in order to work a job (or whatever) so that they are not unfairly discriminated against is different than a child receiving accommodations under the IDEA/504. IDEA/504 basically says you HAVE to accommodate a disabled child under any/all circumstances without exception. ADA says you have to accommodate someone so that they aren't discriminated against and that's something that could be argued legally in court since there is a chance you could prove non-discrimination. I think it would be much harder, if not impossible, to argue a child with a disability could not qualify under either the IDEA or 504.",1649858118

A lot of students already feel like they’re never going to accomplish anything. The last few years have been really rough. The pandemic, social unrest, economic recession- even if people think kids don’t see that, they do. Even if it’s just stuff like “mommy cries a lot now and I don’t get so many snacks at home” or “daddy isn’t home when I go to bed anymore” or “granny died from the pandemic,” kids see that stuff. Some kids might be dealing with an increase in bigotry and discrimination towards them, or some kids might be seeing it more clearly now, or at least conversations have been opened more in the general public forum. Also just being out of school for a year or two is going to make a HUGE difference when it comes to motivation, task persistence, and attention span. Even when I was working from home it was so much easier to just run to the bathroom, grab a snack, watch a quick tiktok or send a snap. It’s the same for the kids. Now they’re expected to adjust basically overnight to standards that some of them may have never even worked under before. I don’t know if there’s an answer. I do think it would be great if we could find a way to encourage people to learn for the love of learning, not just as a means to an end. I genuinely love to learn, so school wasn’t boring to me because I was learning. Not everyone is going to be that way and that’s not a failing on their part, but even if every kid could have just one or two subject areas where they’re genuinely learning for a love of learning, that would be amazing. Also I feel like it would be great to have opportunities for kids to learn more than just math, reading, and writing. My last school basically just taught math, reading, and writing with a rotation of science and social studies (one day science, one day SS), and two days of art a week and one day of gym. Even the art class frequently came out of a textbook. It would probably be boring even to me to just do the same thing day in and day out like that. I’d try to work science into the math and that was actually helpful, or I’d try to work building trades, cooking, decorating, and similar stuff in as well and kids seemed to like that because it was just a breakup of the monotony of “calculate the area of this shape” or whatever.",1649858112

In terms of limits of FAPE, that's very individualized, though each scenario has its own targets for what we aim for (e.g., the state can define how much private tutor time replaces a regular school day or school week). LRE, on the other hand, is a continuum of services. So it's not so much that it has a limit, but more that it has less or more time removed from the general education setting (peers, curriculum, activities, etc.). These placements can range from fully in GenEd settings to completely removed but in the same school, removed to an alt location, therapeutic setting, residential treatment facility, juvenile detention, etc. Ultimately, it still needs to be a setting where the student can receive a free and appropriate public education, even if that FAPE looks different by necessity.",1649857719

You can even request that they do this- although they are not obligated to accept, the reality is that if the parent is a real jerk, it's going to end up on their desk anyway, so they probably won't argue.

In terms of YOUR interactions:

phone- ""I'm sorry but I do not feel that this conversation is productive. Please email me your concerns and then we can discuss them."" I might even send them an email reiterating that you understand that they have concerns and that if they can write out the specifics, you will take the time to respond ""when I'm not with my students"". They will likely not bother because that takes too much work. If they do bother, you now have a paper trail. Document the phone call and request to email in whatever student tracking database your system uses.

email- Forward straight to admin or reply and cc admin. Document the email in your student tracking database and move along.

I do not take abuse from parents. Period. However, I have 20 years of experience behind me that I can reflect on and use as a barometer.

That's switched the fundamental goal of schools from providing education, to turning a profit and they do that by getting more students. When education was the goal, it made sense to support teachers and remove/discipline disruptive students. Teachers were respected because they were providing the education and education was valued.

When profit is the goal, a disruptive student is just as valuable as an attentive student. Disciplining students becomes counter productive, because that might cause them to change schools and lose the school money. Administrators who maximize profit are promoted while those who maximize education and respect are fired. Teachers are now viewed as an expense and are provided the bare minimum support to function. Rude children and troublesome parents are catered to at the expensive of the teachers.

My sociology teacher works those different political opinions into the class by giving us contemporary issues to discuss and link back to the specification. We talked about how globalisation and technological development has impacted the war between Russia and Ukraine, how secularisation has progressed the rights of women and queer people, and how the Black Lives Matter movement is a result of multiculturalism. It helps not only to engage us, but also our exam board loves it if we can use contemporary examples in our essays. Most of the class is left-leaning, especially when it comes to social issues, but we do give other perspectives the same equal light. Being able to openly have those conversations about our political beliefs and why they're so deeply held is important, I think, at least for a mature class, and it's nice to do that in a safe environment where you're allowed to have an honest debate, rather than twitter dot com.

It also helps if the students like the teacher, I think. My sociology teacher is just really nice to be around; she makes the lessons engaging and accessible and there's no stupid questions.

74,i4k6sc0,t3_u24m0e,t3_u24m0e,Doormau5,Teachers,"I think that one of the big reasons for this is how self-centered we have become as a society.  The individual and their desires are the most important thing to a lot of people, especially children.  Further exacerbating this is social media which not only encourages people to act as if they are the most important person in the world but actively rewards this behavior and makes it a ""viable"" career (for the lucky few who make it).  

As a result, we have people who are unwilling to do anything that doesn't conform to their personal desires, be it work or even taking part in simple activities.  

And let's not forget the parents and school systems who either don't do anything to change this behavior or encourage it by reinforcing the idea that the child is the most important person in the world, who can do no wrong and whose every need must be tended to.  

Personally, I think eliminating social media (which is impossible, I know) would go a long way to restore some sanity to these students, but more importantly, we need to stop acquiescing to their demands.  I personally have stopped being nice in class because it gets you nowhere fast.  

Instead, be the strict/asshole-ish teacher in order to show students that they are not the center of your or anyone else's world.  Stop trying to be their friend, trying to make things fun and interactive.  You are a teacher here to teach them. 

At the least, it will get them a little more ready for the real world than the way we are teaching them now.  And if parents complain/admin get on your ass, cover yourself by maintaining an extensive paper trail.",1649855181

Yes! Every day of my life in elementary, high school, and undergrad I felt intense dread about doing my work. 

A number of things were going on. I had that narrow view of the possibilities for my life that school often drills into you - that grades are the most important thing &amp; you are not a worthwhile person if you don't achieve highly in school. I internalized from a young age that it's more important to ignore my own needs to get schoolwork done on someone else's timeline, even when it would've benefited me to spend more time with certain material. A lot of time the things that we were learning was not grounded in meaning, so when stressful things were happening in the world around us (suicide of peers, food insecurity, current events), I felt paralyzed in a way I wasn't yet able to process. I had not yet learned how to compartmentalize horrors of the world in order to be able to be productive (yay, capitalism). And I felt a lot of despair that I had to spend so much of my life (the whole school day + multiple hours at night) working on things that were painfully boring &amp; that I couldn't get any enjoyment out of. And by the time I was in high school, my only associations with schoolwork was ANXIETY, which leaked into every other aspect of life. I spent a lot of time on the internet bc it was a very dissociative and overstimulating way to get reprieve. 

In a way, I managed. I got good grades throughout (although I understand why many can't, who have more complicated things going on than I did, &amp; doing ""well"" was not w/o consequences to my physical &amp; mental health) &amp; am in grad school now, but I would spend hours and hours of the day staring at the wall trying to will myself to do the work &amp; just couldn't, until the anxiety of a deadline would kick me into action. 

I had don't have solutions for you, bc the only thing that worked for me was starting from scratch on my own, in low-pressure situations, to teach myself things that I was interested in. Through developing positive feelings towards a thing that I was learning on my own time, I was able to reduce baseline anxiety, &amp; I was able to start feeling neutral about completing more boring tasks. It's unfortunate that the way school is organized right now, many students are not able to cultivate healthy relationships towards work/learning.",1649855173

We have a lot of freedom here to teach how we want and we are paid quite well (although that's slowly decreasing as we haven't had a cost of living increase in the 15 years I've been teaching, and we've been given less and less budget so I spend more and more of my own wages on materials). I also credit our vert strong union for our working conditions. But if the Conservatives have their way, education is going to be slowly privatized which will be the end of decent public education. We won't have the privileged, able parents advocating for high standards. Someone once commented that the education system is Sweden is so good because there is absolutely no private option, so the rich and privileged fight to make sure it's decent for their kids, which makes it decent for all. 

Anyway my original point was, I don't know why the fuck anyone would teach in the US at all!!  But then I guess, *gestures at the mass teaching exodus*",1649851035

1. **""I know many posts have already addressed the very obvious lack of pay in the teaching world.""** This is largely dependent on geography. In NY, for example, you pass six figures in about 8-10 years of experience. And this is just base pay. It doesn't include any per session ($54 per hour) or earnings from the pension and TDA, or the fact that health insurance is free and *exceptionally* better than 99% of anything private companies offer. If you factor in those things, salary is more like $130,000+. If you get a teacher leadership position, you can add between $7,500 and $20,000 on to that.
2. **""So while I awake at 5:30 to appear ready for the work day at 7:00 A.M. where I will be in the building till 4 P.M. My remote friends awake at 9, work whenever they want to accomplish whatever assigned tasks and finish work by 1 P.M"".** In NY I am contracted to be at work from 8:20 AM until 2:40 PM. Even with my commute, I am home by 3:45 at the latest, while my friends in WFH jobs are still on the clock until 5. Most of them have tech jobs, and no, they do not just complete easy tasks until 1 pm and then do nothing. Their tasks are complicated, demanding, and stressful, and their bosses make them do regular check ins throughout the day, often including up to 5 or 6 pm. They are also beginning to suffer from health issues due to sitting at home all day and staring at screens. Lastly, they get like 3-4 weeks of paid vacation. Not including all the random days I have off throughout the school year, I have 14 weeks of paid vacation. 14 weeks! No other job on the planet will give you that. 
3. **""Because I will be honest If I could trade my 60 plus hour work week to work 30-40 at home for the same pay"".** As a teacher in NY, My work week is more like 37 hours a week. Why is yours so long?

Teachers internalize this ‘Waiting for Superman’ complex by undermining their colleagues.  Administrators and the school boards they serve are fine with this because it provides another layer of control over the workforce.  The reality is that we have the schools that we have due to the larger economic and political forces that dominate our every day lives, namely the class system and the resulting consumer model of education.  The pandemic is not the driver, it simply took the existing environment and furthered it.  

Your approach is reasonable but this is a structural phenomenon so changing schools will probably not do much.  More importantly, if you are to leave be strategic about where you are going, the reason is that the upcoming high school freshmen class were born in 2008, which means that for the next 14 years we will be dealing with the result of a declining birth rate.

My entire school life, I always felt extremely sorry for teachers and swore I could never ever be a teacher because of all the shit they deal with. It got a little better when I got to high school and got into all AP/IB classes so there wasn’t as much riff raff, but it was still a stressful, underpaid and undervalued profession back then. My dad, a crazy Trumper now, railed against the “bleeding heart liberals” running public education and brainwashing the masses. God help us when those idiots reached critical mass and were able to take so much political control in this country. I honestly think that some of the liberal policies such as implementing 504/IEPs and labeling every problem child as having special needs and learning differently has not helped since we passed a bunch of laws and requirements to cater to these issues yet did not provide adequate funding for it. Lastly while I think the abilities for women to have independent lives and careers outside the home has been fantastic on many levels, we also didn’t adequately prepare for the negative impact at home that this movement would have. Homes are empty, parents are now both disengaged and overworked. They have enough money to buy their kids phones and whatever they want but the home structure is not as solid as it used to be. So then social media has taken over as a huge influence on kids and teens. All this has compounded the already stressed public education system. With two working parents, it becomes a lot more tempting to transactionalize public education when it really should be an extension of the community. However, the “community” is not what it once was and parents are now used to just throwing money at their problems or they never had their shit together before having kids which doesn’t set up a good home life either.

Can I say: there’s a lot of nonsense combative, adversarial nonsense from teachers on here that many/(most?) teachers don’t share and that isn’t necessary nor helpful.

Like, the teacher’s actions at the top seem really effective. And some people will be ‘yeah, it’s a war crime—ain’t it great!’, which would understandably make you think you need to be an ass to be a teacher.

But you can also be a teacher who thinks that action was effective because they 1. value the children’s development and recognise the value of boundaries and even healthy sorrow, 2. think it’s important to show children respect by taking their behaviour seriously and communicating with the other adults in their life, 3. they were savvy, fair (and discreet) in addressing the behaving children and their parents, praising them and looking out for their learning environment.

I agree children will try you, esp when you’re new and they think you don’t have boundaries. But you DO NOT need to become someone who’s heartless in order to teach. You can really care for the kids and have firm boundaries that are good for them at the same time.

Source: seminar by Prof Dr Dirk Schumann and at least one monography. Forgot the title but will look it up later if you want it. It’s also part of the 9th or 8th grade curriculum in my part of Germany. 

Still, the result was ironically more social politics. Doesn’t really matter, who installed it AND it definitely made people hungry for more.

Make no mistake, the bean counters who put these rules in place know full well that these sick day banks save the district huge amounts of money in unpaid benefits, essentially robbing teachers of part of their earned compensation. They also know how to create rules that limit the payouts using employment stats. They know, for example, that the average teacher or employee leaves an employer within 5 years, so by restricting those sick day payouts to teachers who have been in the district for more than 5 years, they are shaving off a huge swath of payout liabilities. Another tactic that I hear about are sick day payouts at retirement. But a quick search in the news will yield many many examples of such sick day banks being cancelled at the stroke of a pen after teachers paid in for decades by not using sick leave (Ontario is a famous example). The bean counters also know that many teachers simply don’t live long enough to make it to retirement in the first place and thus never claim the payout. And there is zero recourse for any of this. 

Bottom line: look out for yourself. Use any and all benefits available to you because if you don’t use it you’ll likely lose it. The only winner with sick banks are the districts. They screw you out of taking earned benefits with false promises and red tape, and a system that can be cancelled at a moments notice.",1649828361

but, through all the times im not motivated i still do my work and i still try. why? certainly not because i'm super focused and a great student. no, i do it because my parents have instilled that expectation into me, and also, because nobody can run on motivation to please their parents and morals alone, i know that if i dont do my work ill get in trouble. and it doesn't have to be perfect work, it just has to be try-your-best work. my parents used to be the kind of people who would get mad if i got anything below an A, but recently ive been going through a bit of a rough patch and its hard to even get out of bed. so we have a deal. I try my best on my work, and they're happy with me. but if i don't try, it's over.

the people who do poorly in school that ive talked to, have parents that either dont care or who think their kid is a living saint and can do no wrong. so, i suppose i dont have a solution, but in my opinion, the root of all this, or at least most of this, lies at the feet of incompetent or well-meaning-but-poorly shown parents.",1649826258

Let’s stop pretending your “advocacy” is the only way to advocate for these kids. You know nothing about me or my journey, yet you seem pretty sure in your conclusions.

I am no longer a teacher anymore either (that’s a whole different story), but I did plenty of advocacy for all of my students during my years, and I still consider myself a strong advocate.

You keep talking about people’s reading comprehension, yet you have utterly failed to read anything I have said.

I’m not “shouting” at you (or anyone, for that matter) on the internet because you advocate for LGBT kids. I am pushing back (sure, you can call it shouting) against your moral posturing that you are somehow defending the downtrodden of society by arguing points nobody is making.

You started off calling the other guy a bigot then refused to actually engage on any point they made. Now if you actually do read instead of just reacting to what you *think* I wrote, I will make very clear that I am not saying I think they are right or wrong, and you may recall that I actually said I think it was a bad tactic on their part in an earlier reply.

Then, you kept shifting the goalposts with me too, trying to make this about how I don’t understand the book because of some point only you are making.

You even admonished someone else for digging into your comment history to attack you (a point I agree with you on) only to then do the same thing to me.

I would find your behavior more amusing (although I surely still do) if I wasn’t so worried about the larger trend I see in people to see themselves as the savior of the oppressed and - dare I say it?? Oh I dare! - virtue-signal how wonderful you are while I must be bad for disagreeing, even if that means you must cherry-pick and distort my words to fit your point.

It’s such silliness. I’m sure you won’t take anything away from this conversation other than I am just another deplorable and you stood up against evil. I assure you I actually listened and will consider your words.

After all, I respect that you gave it a go as an AP lit teacher and respect you must be intelligent if you are now an AI engineer. I do think you have a massive blind-spot, but funny enough if we had a beer I’m sure we would find more in common than we don’t. Hell, that’s probably even true if your other internet-adversaries joined us at the table.

I am a third grade teacher. And we do morning meetings daily and we have a fun fact of the day,  a joke / puzzle of the day, a poll of the day, a share out.

A feelings / mood check in with kid related memes. 

We also have regular routines for reading. Students also read daily for 30 minutes. Which is a consistent daily quiet read time. 

We also give students breaks when transitioning. We use YouTube related exercise videos and brain breaks related to concepts and kid pop culture. We also have drawing breaks related to kid pop culture or unit related drawings. 

In writing, students are given multiple ways to have autonomy such as choosing areas of focus within our unit, or writing their own versions of writing.

In math, concepts are related to things on their lives, like specials, current units, pop culture references, or school related events, or to themselves where they can use their numbers in their families or culture to create math problems.  Breaking up math lessons into different components helps too. We have our math routine, or mini lesson, our explore, where kids get to work together or in groups, and then we all come back and share together as a class.

Don't be firm. 

Be an asshole.

Most new teachers underestimate how ""firm"" they're being. Gather your anger inside you and let it erupt through your voice in a commanding, loud, clear tone. Channel every wrongdoing they've hit you with into how you speak to them. You're not going to *scream* at the kids. But it's going to feel like you're borderline yelling. 

They are in *your* classroom. They have the nerve to come in to *your* space and disrespect you? How fucking *dare* they?

Lay down the fucking law. They're going to sit quietly and do their work or they're headed to the office. No warnings. No 3 strikes you're out. One chance. Shut the fuck up and sit the fuck down or get out. You are a human being. You deserve to be able to do you job without being harrassed in these ways. It is *not* supposed to be like this. To the office.

Let me guess - your admin doesn't want you to send kids to the office cause they're too busy? Good. Send them anyway. Keep sending them until admin gets the picture. 

What's the worst case scenario here? You make a kid cry. They run home to their parents, parents call admin. And now admin actually has to address their behavior in your room. Absolute worst case, you get fired/non-renewed. And is that so bad? You're thinking about quitting anyway. 

It's not going to feel good to act this way towards the kids. You're going to feel like a terrible teacher and a terrible person. 

But this is not about being a cutesy teacher with their students all learning and doing wonderful. This is now about survival. Get through the year, and don't take any more crap. Next year, start new and law down the law from day 1. Those kids might be insane in the rest of the building but this is *your* classroom and what you say goes.

Before I elaborate, two things.

1. TLDR: there isn't one. Too complex a subject to collapse into a couple of sentences.
2. IMNAT, but I bring the perspective of ""a good student"" who hated school. Honor roll (usually all As and a B), high school valedictorian, attended a big name university on an ROTC scholarship, graduated *magna cum laude*.

As I experienced it, **school was something done ""to"" the students, not ""with"" them**. The teachers spewed information at the students, who were expected to sit there perfectly still and perfectly quiet (unless spoken to), absorb the information, then regurgitate it on a test. The classroom environment was not engaging, and fundamentally an exercise in obeying orders under the threat of punishment.

**School was basically coercive in nature**, with the chief motivator being the avoidance of punishment. Do your homework, or be kept in from recess to do it. Learn this material, because you'll be tested on it later. Didn't do well on the test? Time to get yelled at. Fear eventually loses its effectiveness as a motivator.

The **connection between the material and the real world became more and more dubious** **as time went on**. When I got to Geometry, the adults in my life could no longer help with homework. They clearly had no need of it in daily life, and had forgotten what they might have learned in school themselves. If none of these adults could do geometry, trig, or calculus, while being successful in their lives, what was the relevance to the real world? Why engage?

**Homework**. Yuck. Where to begin? 

1. After sitting still / quiet all day, while obeying a bunch of orders, I wanted to do things that I wanted to do. Nope. Gotta do homework. Lots of repetitive drudgery. For math in particular, homework could be a teacher's way to offload the actual teaching of the material onto the student's family. Parents or older siblings (for those fortunate enough to have a support system) were expected to ""help"" (i.e.: explain what the teacher couldn't or didn't). 
2. Though nominally an instructional tool, homework was oftentimes used as a punishment. How are the students going to have a positive view of something that's a punishment? More coercion.

**Time spent memorizing a bunch of facts, without gaining useful knowledge.** Much time got spent on lists of what the different countries of a given region imported, exported, possessed as natural resources, etc., which we were expected to regurgitate on a test. What's there to like about this? What would one do with this, assuming they actually remembered it after the test?

**Once you get to the real world, what's the relevance?** The old social contract where doing well in school led to getting a ""good job"", good pay, good benefits, etc. basically went out the window in the 80s as the economy became financialized. Look at all the folks who played the game by the rules and can't find a ""good job"".

**Wrapping up.** I wish I had the magic solution, but there's no single fix. 85% of what happens in any given environment is the product of the environment itself. How do you fix the environment? How do you make school more collaborative? Less coercive? Relevant to real life? How to restore the rewards for hard work? Only then will students have a reason to be actively engaged, instead of just along for the ride.

This issue needs to be addressed at the higher levels of the educational institutions and potentially by employers as well.",1649823685

The downs: they are irresponsible and unpredictable. I now teach 6 different periods per day, compared to 3 periods per day in highschool. More pressure to make everything ""fun"".

The closest thing they have to what you're talking about is a scene where they talk about dosing embryos in utero with certain levels of hormones to accelerate or interrupt the development. Literally nothing to do with gender. Genetics and eugenics? Sure. But literally nothing to do with hormonal treatments for gender. Even if it was, we're talking about a treatment that literally saves lives by reducing suicide rates significantly. To compare it to evidence of a dystopia is just flat wrong. You might as well say chemo is evil because they have medicine in BNW. Same degree of association. 

This guy is literally conflating a life-saving treatment that is completely opt-in with a book about a dystopian future that has fuck all to do with this topic. I taught BNW for 5 years in a row in AP Lit, and I have no time or patience for people who can't even understand the damned book to use it as a thinly-veiled way to take pot shots at the Trans community. Again--if this guy had pointed to interracial marriage as evidence of ""Dystopia"", no one would have any trouble understanding how that statement was bigoted and hateful. He didn't make a statement about race, but he did make one about gender.

47,i4is405,t3_u2cki4,t3_u2cki4,oddntt,Teachers,"You know.. I'm torn with this one. On one hand it isn't as formally detrimental as a referral for the student, but on the other, it is planned peer-humiliation. I think the blanket call was probably not so bad for anyone involved in this instance (because it was so out of control), but in an area with high levels of domestic violence, this isn't a good idea. Heck, they might be misbehaving because of issues at home in the first place (especially an entire class -2). This would only worsen any of that which would come back to you.

I'm sure there are better strategies for you to access like private calls to avoid FERPA issues discussing a student's academic issues in front of people who do not have the legal right to the information. Classroom structure can also play a role as it is a general rule of thumb in education that behavior is directly related to proximity. So setting up a class where you stand in the middle or do walk-bys frequently as an example. Even greeting them at the door with a unique fact about them has statistically improved classroom absorbtion and compliance. Also, you must have other teachers there that have dealt with a similar class makeup unless this is the first grade of that school. So, asking other teachers what strategies they employed to work with that specific group might actually be really good for your ability to maintain the classroom's educational readiness. I'm going to say that misbehavior won. They boiled you over, and you deferred authority. This is sometimes necessary, but it can be like pressing the nuke button on your own authority. I'd agree that it is a last resort tactic, and I hope it actually was.

I'd like to conclude that I was a straight A student who suffered from extreme domestic violence. I use to stand in the back of class claiming I was to tired to sit but it's because it hurt too much to sit on the bruises from my back to my legs. I'd even act out if I didn't get this accommodation. Something like a blanket call would have meant 10x the beating. I remember once my dad helped me with my math and the teacher marked it wrong. I stood in front of him and told him he needed to change it on my paper because otherwise I couldn't go home. Group punishment like this was and still is unfair.

22,i4ipvci,t3_u24m0e,t3_u24m0e,bohemian_plantsody,Teachers,"The issue is systemic and, I think, too large for one teacher to fix. I've been wondering this too for years.

Kids believe they they don't have to do anything they don't want to do. For a lot of the kids, its ""I don't want to do &lt;subject&gt;. I don't want to be here."" The refusal is a form of protest, and is especially fueled if the kid believes there will not be a consequence (""You can call my mom, she won't care!""). And, chances are, the kid is right. When others see a kid pull this off, more join in, and it compounds the issue. After all, ""they can't punish all of us"". I have not yet figured out how to remove the option to refuse. I believe there are too many variables to do so (requiring an admin to back you up, requiring parents that give a shit).

At the same time though, I do wonder if the current 'mental health crisis' is playing into this. The Internet is empirically leading to increased mental health concerns in kids, and school work might just be the last straw. After all, would you really care about a Science lab report if you knew that, when you got home, you had so much other, and bigger, shit to deal with? Not to mention larger issues like the climate crisis that are weighing on these kids (""why do I care about school if there won't be a future to use my education in?"").

This is likely multifaceted and I don't believe there's a universal solution here. The closest I've come is if you have such a strong rapport that the kids do their best as a way to not let you down.",1649819715

The only thing I'm confident is how much the system fails people. I was misdiagnosed with ADHD at a young age and then put on Adderall for 7 years. It was a rather miserable existence. My IEP was probably the only thing that kept me in school. I transitioned away from it. I have a 3.79 gpa and I'm in quite a few honors classes. For many, the IEPs help kids live a normal life in school.

The myth that everyone can compete on the same level is ridiculous. Also if a person actually has a disability or a disorder they don't simply grow out of it. Due to the IEPs and academic support at my school, we have many successful students that otherwise wouldn't be. I'm grateful I had these resources, but many kids don't get them and drop out or fail completely. 

Coping skills and learning skills were taught when I was in my academic support class. They do help but they aren't a silver bullet.

Thompson, if that’s a reasonable commute for you, was great as well. Staff are pretty closeknit, and the Loveland community is also very close and interconnected. A lot of diversity, especially socioeconomic, in Thompson that you don’t find as much in Fort Collins. One thing I really liked about Loveland was that people tend to stay there: people I worked with grew up there, went to the high schools they taught in, have 3 or 4 generations of family all in the same neighborhood, etc. It was fun to have students who were the nieces and nephews, cousins, godchildren, etc of the teachers.",1649819098

3.  Don't bring work home.  I can't tell you how many weekends I've spent with a pile of work to grade and I bring it back Monday ungraded.  And I'm stressed all weekend finding time to do the corrections.  Instead I grade it when students are working, or like I said in #1, I have them grade it.

However, I think the point you're making is valid.  Accommodations and modifications are necessary for students to succeed, and they need to be listed on IEPs to ensure that they are being met.  At the same time, special education teachers and related service providers should be working with students to help them understand their accommodations and develop ways to support their own learning.   Ideally, data will be collected throughout the year, and at the annual review, accommodations should be carefully reviewed.  As students learn tools to support themselves, they may no longer need specific line item accommodations.  The goal should be to reduce necessary accommodations not because the disability is gone but because students have learned how to personally adapt.  Accommodations should never be removed unilaterally, and they should absolutely never be removed without clear data pointing to removal.",1649816887

88,i4iiqd5,t3_u2clty,t3_u2clty,lavache_beadsman,Teachers,"I believe colleges do need to give extra time for disabilities, but that's neither here nor there.

IEPs aren't meant to be permanent. A student on an IEP has very specific goals, and the idea is that if he/she meets those goals by his/her next re-evaluation date, the student will no longer need an IEP, or will soon no longer need an IEP (or at least, whatever accommodations a student with a disability needs will be minimal). Whether or not the student is caught up in seventh grade or in tenth, I don't think really matters.

In some ways, you're right though, because of course, in practice, IEPs aren't temporary. Students usually have them throughout their academic careers, and the accommodations they're provided with are usually substantial. 

I guess the question is what should we do about it? I don't think these children are better-served by just getting rid of their accommodations after seventh grade. I think a start is being a little more stingy with accommodations, and maybe we don't need to give a student EVERY possible accommodation just because they have an IEP. I'd also like to see less pull-outs. But even that just scratches the surface.",1649816430

 The article you linked literally just explains what puberty blockers are. It doesn't provide any statistics for how often these are administered, and if certainly doesn't support the BS narrative you're pushing about children having their ""hormones regulated"" as if they don't have a say in the matter. 

The article states that puberty begins at around 10 or 11, not that most kids given blockers start at 10 or 11. They're literally defining puberty. The second sentence acts as a modifier on the information provided in the first, clarifying that when a patient starts taking puberty blockers will determine the effect the puberty blockers have. It's not a smoking gun showing that doctors are going around regulating the hormones of unsuspecting children to push some liberal agenda or whatever BS someone fed you. 

[Here are some real statistics on the frequency of use of puberty blockers for transgender youth](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7073269/#:~:text=Of%20the%20sample%2C%2016.9%25%20reported,%2C%202.5%25%20received%20pubertal%20suppression).  

&gt; ""Of the sample, 16.9% reported that they ever wanted pubertal suppression as part of their gender-related care. Their mean age was 23.4 years, and 45.2% were assigned male sex at birth. Of them, 2.5% received pubertal suppression. After adjustment for demographic variables and level of family support for gender identity, those who received treatment with pubertal suppression, when compared with those who wanted pubertal suppression but did not receive it, had lower odds of lifetime suicidal ideation (adjusted odds ratio = 0.3; 95% confidence interval = 0.2–0.6).""

So, our takeaways here are:

- the average person given puberty blockers is well into their 20s

- giving them to people who request them reduces their chances of suicide by a very significant margin

You don't like it? Then don't take puberty blockers. Otherwise, kindly STFU. People like you and the BS you spread are a big part of why so many Trans kids end up taking their own lives in the first place.",1649815955

Over time, all of those independent projects means that they have less opportunity to learn social skills on a productive level, which causes major issues in group work settings. It doesn't help that some develop a superiority idea that causes them to look down on their peers simply based on the belief that they are ""better"" because they are ""smarter.""

Eventually, those kids will reach a point where they are truly challenged to learn something new and many have become so stuck on the idea of how smart they are that they cannot handle failure. They truly don't understand how to learn. All of those things together can often create a perfect storm of entitled jerks.

In my 18 years teaching I have only had 2 advanced/TAG students who didn't need intensive work on their social interaction skills.

As someone who had an IEP in high school, teachers who shared similar sentiments to OP made my life really needlessly difficult. I was “naturally intelligent” and quite often received comments that I was smart enough to problem solve my way through tasks these (sometimes well intentioned, sometimes simply just not) adults deemed “straightforward.” 

I spent my entire k-12 education coming home in tears: between the misguided efforts of various teachers to encourage me out of needing my IEP, those who questioned my need for one at all - often way too aggressively, and repeatedly being scared with speeches about “when you’re an adult you have to just make an effort to be better at these coping strategies because no one will help you!” … it was overwhelming. I internalized that I just needed to try harder and be better, that any help being offered to me was a crutch that didn’t reflect real life, and that if I couldn’t work without accommodation now my life was basically over as I’d never amount to anything. 

I just want to encourage anyone who has read this tangent of a comment to please not be the reason some nine year old needs therapy because she doesn’t want to grow up and be forced into a mean world where no one will help her. 

(Also I’m sure it’s been mentioned but I absolutely was provided reasonable accommodation at college and am always given reasonable accommodation at my jobs. I am not a worse adult for having or using those tools.)

Most schools l have worked at do, if not you could ask a more experienced teacher or admin what the deal is. Seems crazy to grade 100 make-up tests that day.

Attendance policy should also be spelled out in the school handbook -- usually in order to be accredited schools must have some sort of ""no credit"" for over X amount of absences, but since there's always a lot of pressure on graduation rates some don't follow it.

I'd basically just go along with whatever your school says -- if they say more than X absences means you should enter a grade of NC, do it, otherwise don't let attendance factor into the grade and try to grade them on their mastery of the material.

In general, you will come under more scrutiny for failing too many students than you will for giving too many A's. Until you have more experience, grade liberally -- it will only make the students like you more. It can be tempting to think ""oh if I don't put in all these 0's they'll never do the work"" but really, were they gonna do it anyways?

Every kid is worthy. Every single kid.

Then begin to fade- so in their most successful class they have the para for half of that class, if they continue to be successful without the support then you fade the entire class period, if they begin to ‘slip’ then you add the support back until they gain the skills to function in that setting successfully and it continues.

My ADHD was diagnosed in kindergarten, and I started medication in 1st grade when I also was in my own reading group because I was too far ahead of the other students. I didn't need an IEP until high school. But my ability to compensate for my ADHD academically without any accommodation in all subjects reached some limits at that point. I struggled to finish written impromptu tests within the time limit because I needed to organize my thoughts before I could start my response. I was very good at math, but I needed more time on tests to be able to finish. Teachers would not give me the accommodations because I didn't have an IEP, and my grades slipped in several classes. 

My first IEP was in 11th grade. I only needed extra time for tests, and I was able to get 1.5 of the time allowed. I was able to get extra time for the ACT and AP tests. I excelled, attended a top-20 university which provided time accommodations as needed and even a quiet room alone for tests on occasion, and I graduated magna cum laude. One of my friends was diagnosed with ADHD her sophomore year of college and started medication for the first time. That was when she reached her threshold for compensating.

Yes college students will get electronic versions of their textbooks so they can listen to them and for tests they can have a “reader” sit and read the questions and answers to them, something I’ve done many times. They do get additional time for tests and assignments as needed, and that includes standardized testing. We had a ton of law students with testing accommodations, for example; they got extra time on their LSATs and everything. Students with frequent illness-related absences get leeway with attendance, students with processing disorders can get assigned notetakers, etc. 

It’s true workplaces aren’t going to give the same level of support but most of these issues are primarily related to academics and employers are legally required to provide reasonable accommodations. I did wonder about a few students, such as the future dietician with numerous accommodations for dyscalculia and the education major with significant health issues leading to numerous absences (how would that ever work for a teacher?!??), but most of them were going into careers where things like needing extra processing time or accessing reading materials in an alternative format will probably not be a major hindrance.

The thing is if you provide all these good supports throughout high school and college, it ensures they have the best chance of learning what’s needed so they can eventually go into a workplace with minimal supports. But few can function at their optimal levels until they’re adults.",1649813958

If they are talking or out of their seat, these are behaviors that can be addressed with verbal warnings or phone calls home at the end of the day. As a rule of thumb, it's a good idea to let students make their own choices. Give them the chance to resolve their behavior and let them know what the consequence will be if they don't. Then, follow through with said consequence. Always make sure you consequence aligns with the behavior. Talking or refusing to stay in their seat warrants maybe a detention or phone call home if it happens a lot in one class period. If it happens everyday, document and stack the consequences until you can write a referral.

I would avoid calling for an administrator unless a student is cussing you out or about to fight yourself or another student. It's great your admin offered this support, but you don't want to abuse it. Keep that card in your pocket and only use it when you have no other choice.

1,i4ibi03,t3_u2dpb4,t3_u2dpb4,effectivemarshmallow,Teachers,"When is it that you're having trouble getting their attention? At the beginning of class or after they're doing group work?

I like using a timer on the board for group work, once the timer has gone off and they see you visually move to the front of the room and change the slide, they pretty much all know they should be quiet. I only have to do a countdown when they're really getting into it with their groups.

At the beginning of class you could do something to indicate class starting -- turn the lights on, put up the same opener slide with the day's objective, start class with a random/funny trivia fact or question to grab their attention.

It's not just a question of your volume, the issue is also that the first few kids to hear you ask for attention are seeing it as optional, so a reset of expectations, why you need them to quiet down when you ask, how much you love them and don't want to strain your throat, what the procedure is that you will follow when you want quiet, etc. could help as well. 

If there are any students you notice never quiet down or are the biggest instigators of continued noise, find a moment for a 1-1 check in and ask a relationship building question (like, how's soccer season going) plus hey--I've noticed you're sometimes one of the people chatting and not quieting down when I ask, is there anything I can do to help you? You're a leader at your table and the others seem to follow whatever it is that you're doing, so if you want me to move you I can, but I think you could really be a good example for Remi.

16,i4ib88w,t3_u2by7q,t3_u2by7q,SpiritedAwayToo,Teachers,"I have a different take but I'm Gen X and so my parents were Boomers. When I was a kid, the teacher was always right, even when she/he was wrong. Parents generally backed teachers without questioning, just like they'd let other adults (e.g. neighbors) scold their child...they were elders to be respected. When I fractured my thumb in elementary school, my horrible teacher made me use my fingers on the splinted hand to write. When I told my parents, it took some reflection on their part until they, very politely, *asked* my teacher to stop doing that. As a result, tons of people my age had really crappy school experiences and they carry some significant resentment. I became a teacher because I hated my own school experience and I wanted to be one of the good teachers. 

I feel like lots of people like me grew up and had kids and thought...there is NO way any teacher is going to do my kid wrong like I was wronged. And then I think that sentiment went too far, like a kneejerk reaction. We raised Millennial children and we overcompensated to make up for the overbearing Baby Boomer adults whose shadow we silently grew up under. We went way in the other direction to build self esteem, give awards for too many things, and put them first. There's a balance somewhere but many of us went too far. 

I  think US society is generally anti-teacher because of what my generation went through...we went from being silent and having the adults' word taken over ours to believing the individual child's wishes are always primary over everyone else. Go to any homeschool list with Gen X parents and ask them what elementary school is like. You'll hear about being forced to sit quietly and passively in one solo desk all day like a cog in a machine, mindlessly accepting authority...because that's what school was like for us long ago. I briefly homeschooled my kids for this reason, before actually visiting a school and then eventually becoming a teacher myself.

I went to college with a student who was severely dyslexic. He was able to get his books on tape. In the meantime  I read to him. His understanding of economics was far superior to mine and I am always thankful that we had that arrangement. 

Now, I am a HS special education teacher. I have worked with colleges of my seniors to ensure their college has supports they can access. 

It is very hard to ask for a 504 in college if there is no previous record of it. 

Part of my instruction to my students with IEPs is how to navigate the world with and without their accommodations; how to find them, how to ask for them. If students aren't leaving school with the knowledge of how to navigate in the world, that's bad teaching not the IEP fault.

I have worked many different jobs (food service, customer service, teaching) you ABSOLUTELY  can ask for things to be read to you or use your phone/web app to do it; or get support if you experience dyscalculia.

I feel like I’d eventually get tired of school and tune it all out too. Yesterday and today, they took some kind of test that isn’t a state test but is close to the state test that will show how prepared the kids are for this upcoming state test that they still have to take for 4 days. Both days had 55 questions (they are 9), took over 3 hours. He missed recess both days bc of this test and his PE time was cut short. Has to do it all over again tomorrow. Not to mention, he has to do another benchmark test the week after spring break then do 4 days of state testing. I saw his teacher today and she was fed up with all of it too. So it isn’t the teacher’s fault. Admin was told they have to administer this test.
I think after a while, kids can tell that the “powers that be” don’t care about them as humans, they are just a number. Who in their right minds tests children this much? I failed to mention, even kindergarteners sat through this baloney and took this test.
**I’m not blaming us. We all know we hate it too. Admin hates it. I had another teacher tell me she’s tired of teaching to these stupid tests just to make herself seem like a decent teacher.

- I ain't in debt for 100k after being done with university. That baffles me that it is possible in the USA.

- I have complete freedom over how I plan my classes, as long as it follows the big lines of the government's curriculum.

I have great respect for all teachers across the USA. Everytime I come here, I ser courageous people doing the same job I do, but with much more challenges.

It has changed a bit, yes. It's more understanding than it was 5, 10, 40 years ago, yes... But certainly hasn't changed enough to explain or condone all the things being done within the education system.

A lot of students are being sheltered or living in a bubble that will burst pretty quickly when they leave the classroom - and they'll not be ready to take on the world because they're taught that people around them/the environment will do everything or almost everything to accommodate *them*... And since they aren't truly taught coping skills or stress tolerance, the slightest thing will break them.

Another reason I'd agree with you is that I also want them to tackle obstacles by themselves, to succeed on their own, to solve problems without help besides their skills, smarts, and knowledge - I reckon teaching someone to fish will be better for them as opposed to giving them the fish myself.

Now, from an idealistic perspective, I don't want to think (or perhaps ""accept"" is the word to use...) that they must learn to fend for themselves because the world is such an unforgiving place that it won't give them a break. It shouldn't be that way... But as a wise person once told me, ""the way things **should be** and the way they **are** usually aren't the same thing"".

What about kids who struggle to read and write. Why not give them more 1 on 1 support rather than allowing them to use a computer for tests and assessments all the time? This creates a vicious cycle where they will never be able to write on their own.

As a former talented/gifted kid, I can say that a lot of it may have to do with misdirected pressure without an outlet. They likely get a ton of pressure at home to be the best and the smartest, and so school is a competition. However, it's not like sports. You can't be the official ""winner"" of school like you can in a soccer game or road race. Because of that, the kids keep going for ""wins"" in class to assert that they really are the smartest. They don't ask for help, because asking for help makes you look weak.

My suggestion would honestly be to reduce the impact grade competitions have in your class. Provide the kids with an ""out""--- maybe difficult critical thinking assignments are participation-based rather than strictly graded. As another commenter said, provide consequences for rudeness, but don't hold grudges--- these kids will remember if you were unfair. Lastly, provide the extra help you think they need upfront, particularly in terms of study skills.

I think there is a need to have IEPs, especially for students with diagnosed disabilities. However, there needs to be an expectation put on each of the main parties (parents, student, school, and teacher). If a student has ""anxiety"", an IEP needs to be developed whereby teachers give allowances, but it is expected that parents also implement practices to help their child (e.g. taking their child to the psychologist/counsellor), schools provide support services external to the teacher (e.g. anxiety programs run by school counsellors), and that the student actively participates in these.

2. Yes. Text to speech software exists and is available for teachers to use as well. I have a coworker who uses it because it helps with his dyslexia. 

3. Also, would you believe, kinda yeah? Like if a kid is about to make me blow up, I can ask them to step into the hallway for a moment until I'm chill enough to talk to them. I could also ask my buddy teacher next door to watch my class for a minute (I've occasionally done this for bathroom breaks.) 

And I'm an adult. Not a child. And certainly not a child who is constantly forced to take standardized tests on multiple subject areas. 

These accommodations aren't unreasonable. And in the real world, if a reasonable accommodation couldn't be made to scaffold a job for someone, they would just get a different job, do something else. But our kids don't have the option to just...do something other than school. So sometimes the accommodations we have to give in order to allow them to achieve their *legally mandated education* are of a higher burden than you would expect to see in a work place setting, since the work force has a lot more variation than public school classes. 


And like, *oh no* a kid took longer than you wanted on a test. Clearly their legally guaranteed accommodations should be taken from them. 🙄


Look, sometimes kids outgrow certain accommodations and parents/ARD committees can be hesitant to make adjustments to the IEP. I get that. Totally.

We have 4 floors and a tech wing, I rotate one a day to make a sweep 30 minutes after contract hours each day and encourage teachers to leave. There are always the random ones that are there because they have a legitimate reason like a vacay coming up or something, but if I see someone late everyday, it’s a big red flag for me. That tells me that something isn’t quite right and there are a million reasons it could be. They could be struggling professionally or personally, and either way I need to know that so I can support them to the best of my ability. It breaks my heart sometimes in my rounds. I have seen so many first year teachers crying after school it isn’t funny. 

Disagree: admin loves the free labor. FUCK THAT .. as long as you guys keep working for free, society will let it. If something can’t get done in my school in a reasonable amount of time and it is taking teachers free labor to get it done, I stop it, we don’t have it, and I tell my home and school organizations exactly why.

51,i4i3ovm,t3_u24m0e,t3_u24m0e,persontryingtobegood,Teachers,"Why? Inflation has outpaced wage growth for decades, hollowing out the middle class so people are living paycheck-to-paycheck, reducing their ability to care for their kids. Also, technology is addictive and kids (and most adults) don't have the self-awareness to realize that addiction is bad for them, they just know that they want more of the addictive substance and could care less about everything else. Also, hormones. Also, media and peers lying about the usefulness and enjoyment of engaging in education, which are both high despite the lies about a ""failing school system"" which does incredible work in a failing socioeconomic system. Also, possible negative experiences with school in the past. Also, possibly trauma in individual cases.

What can you do as a professional teacher who can't make problems disappear with magic? In order of importance:

Step 0) Your own mindset. You are not a superhero or a savior. You are a professional. ER surgeons have patients die on the operating table. Mechanics look at cars and say ""I can't fix that, send it to the junkyard."" You will have students you can't reach. (Although many of those students will go on to live fine lives even though they learned nothing in your class). Do your job well and then go home, leaving your work thoughts at work.

1) Be visibly, obviously helpful to the other students in the class. This means **specific** feedback. Bad feedback ""make this better"" ""work harder"" ""focus"" ""this is great."" Good feedback ""This right here is evidence. And this here is where you connected the evidence to your thesis."" ""I asked for description, but you didn't describe what it looks like. Describe what it looks like in three sentences."" If they see you rocking it as a teacher, they may want to join.

2) Talk to them about neutral, positive things so you aren't nagging them 24/7. Talk about trucks, video games, anime or whatever the hell they will talk to you about. Maybe you can connect it to their work later, maybe not. But nagging someone to do work and telling them that they fail to meet your expectations 100% of the time is just rude. Treat them like a person.

3) Hit them with positive, relevant expectations every day. Say the following even though you know there is a .1% chance of the kid doing work. ""I am expecting you to do some work today. I think you are capable of doing this work, and if you need help I will help you. It will be useful to you in life to be able to start your work, learn how to get better at your work, and finish your work, so I'm asking you to do some work."" Then disengage and teach the kids who are ready to learn.

4) Consequences. Try to attach negative consequences to negative behavior and positive consequences to positive behavior. (PBIS DOES NOT REQUIRE that all consequences are positive). Set reasonable work expectations for the student. If they normally work 0 minutes per class, ask for 5, not 50. Then.....Didn't do five minutes? Phone call home, detention, bad grades, miss field trips, miss recess. Did do five minutes? Phone call home (positive!), candy, fist bump, extra recess, five minutes at the end of class to play cool math games. Sure, intrinsic motivation is great when it happens. But often extrinsic motivation is the first step on that journey.

5) Mix rigor and engagement. I can plan pretty intricate, engaging lessons where we start by observing an artifact, then we think-pair-share, then we work in small groups to close read and answer questions, then we watch a video and answer questions on edpuzzle, then we create and give a presentation blah blah blah. My best lesson plans usually go like this: ""You have an hour to write a good essay. If everyone writes a good essay in less than an hour, we have the rest of the time for extra recess. I suggest you work hard and be quiet so I can help everyone to write a good essay, so then we all get extra recess."" And then sometimes you just have to spend a week entirely on rigor or a week (the week before vacation) entirely on some engaging project. As long as you balance rigor and engagement, you're good. 

Side note: I have kids in my class who exhibit this exact behavior, and I do all of these things. It's not guaranteed to work, and if someone else has better ideas, listen to them instead.",1649810002

There was a really good article a few years ago about what a mental marathon school was after an adult followed a kids schedule for the day - it’s kind of the basis for my line of thinking here. 
I will say that more of mine are engaged than they let on. They may have the passive stare of a dairy cow, but many of them are listening and retaining. My principal only thinks they’re engaged if they’re “doing” something but listening doesn’t really have any outward indicators.

I've learned in poor districts; I've taught in poor schools; I've parented in well off schools.

Without state tests, students in poorer schools will be taught less.  State testing is not the best answer, but it is one answer and a better solution than no state testing.

Look at all the posts on here - from a lot of middle- and high school teachers - that complain about admin and admin-adjacent people asking the teacher 'so what are you doing to get Johnny's grades up and passing by the end of the year.'

No state testing means more students get by and get pushed onwards without learning anything.

Is it heartbreaking to have a 6th grader ask the teacher proctor the meaning of certain words so that he can answer the question on the state test?  Yes it is - it is heartbreaking because his education structure has failed to teach him how to adequately read; the education structure includes the parents, the schools, the politicians, the admins, and the teachers.  As the student gets older, it includes the student more and more as well.  

State testing helps to make the system teach the lowest ""performers"" at the lowest schools \*something\* that democratic society has deemed relevant (the state's curriculum).

 School needs to be redone from the ground up and focusing on getting kids to like the actual learning part and avoid alienating kids from the system.

There are at least four generations of people who have an absolute hatred for school and anything to do with school.

The main reasons are because the schools tried to enforce soft skills - arriving on time, accepting responsibility, accepting criticism, deference to those in position over you and the like.

Students hear how much the parents and grandparents hated school and teachers.  They adopt the same attitude and bring it to school.  When a call home is made or a parent has to come to the school, it is a chance for the parents to get back at what the school has done previously.

What are the sight words numbers? Was there RTI, or targeted interventions to address teacher concerns? Will you as a parent agree to a 504, if necessary? An IEP? What are you ready to do for your kid? More vocabulary practice, watch strategy videos, or ask the teacher for teaching strategies? 

Ask what assessments they use and look up ranges to check on the teachers assessment. There has to be more of a measure than ‘level e ‘ readers’

MY admin came in two years ago to ""fix"" a broken school. It had high behaviors, low performance, and even the teachers had no professionalism. 

The thing is, she isn't allowed to tell the state that she's going to start doing the old fashioned things that the county North of us does to get more than double our data with a similar population. Letting teachers do their jobs without micromanaging and punishing kids no matter how much their parents whine isn't the new hip thing to do and no company is selling it. 

They have to show that they bought x program and put in x accountability measure. Which means that every teacher has more work than they can do and quits as soon as they can. No matter how good a first year teacher is they will never be as good as a totally average 12th year teacher. 

Kids are used to being able to do what they want. They continue to. We can't crack down but instead are told to use PBIS tokens as a reward for the 2 kids who care. Those kids stop caring because the PBIS tokens are never able to be spent because the admin who is supposed to open the store once a week is busy double checking after teachers to make sure we did our ""I promise I did my job"" forms. 

So then nothing gets better. And principals get a nitpicked list of what's wrong. Except they can't say ""your AP let this girl sit with her all day because she didn't want to have to turn in her phone like the other kids and didn't want to take her ELA test"". It's that the room had paper on the floor. Yes. We have 3 fights a day and are an average of 5 years behind because of dust. Sure. 

We get a new program. Not collabing well? Is it because your teachers are all exhausted and trying to catch up on their filling out the form forms? Nope. It's because they need another form to fill out! And more babysitting! 

Your teachers had a real planning day on friday if they finished the endless sea of RTI meetings by busting their asses and sometimes staying after school? Sounds like they have room for a PL by a woman who taught magnet school 20 years ago telling us that she used how much kids hated her as a consequence (you think sitting next to the teacher is a punishment lady?

It's the ultimate corporate dystopia. Corporations have licensed everything from the air we breathe, to our bodily functions, to even step we take. 
  
People are permanently attached to an altered reality device that controls what they can see and so they can charge you for your actions.  While walking, the sidewalk is covered in AR ads that charge you for the privilege to step on their space. The main character uses an app that lays out a path that costs the least during his walks. 
  
On top of that, the AR device will project people's avatars over their bodies. That way you can only see what they paid for you to see. He describes a scene in the subway where everyone looked so pretty, but smelled terrible because they were hiding behind their avatars. At one point, he accidentally disables that feature and gets a real look at another person. He got charged just to see that person's real face.

84,i4hqz5v,t3_u24m0e,t3_u24m0e,thecooliestone,Teachers,"I think it is two things--one at home and one at school. 

1)As others have said no kid loves school. But it has recently happened that teachers are expected to make them. A few amazing educators who are able to come in and be high energy and charismatic and fun all period (likely at the expense of their own mental health and families) mean that kids think if at any point they are bored the teacher is doing something wrong. My kids say ""I'm acting up because I'm bored"" not as a way to express the work isn't hard enough but to say that they don't love learning grammar. Even making things fun is risky. I had a game to learn cause and effect--they were teams of countries that events impacted differently. And then they all failed the quiz on Friday on purpose because they were mad we didn't have another day of the game. I was bored in school. I never told my teacher that, much less thought it was an excuse to have a 23. 

2) A lot of education has always been pointless. We know this. The fact that kids can't only have one teacher past 3rd grade shows that most people don't need to know things past 3rd grade. I think there are other reasons to learn in depth things. You need to know how to analyze literature because it teaches important concepts of critical thinking and media analysis. But we aren't allowed to tell kids that. We test them to death and wonder why they think we only care about tests. My test scores doubled when I stopped putting them in the gradebook and said we were only taking them so I could flex on my grade level partner who they hated. The hyperfixation on standards only instead of standard based education means that actual skills are left behind. Case in point, I was trying to teach my students how to block out a long text to read it better. I got docked twice--one because it wasn't a standard and two because teaching students strategies to cope with texts above their level isn't differentiating--I should have given half the class of 7th graders a 1st grade story and taught theme for the 8th time. IT was only when it was put on the state test that we were even allowed to grade them based on grammar. And that was because the kids had totally illegible writing. 

Kids are figuring out the holes in education due to social media, and companies lobbying to rip those holes wide open aren't helping. Imagine you're a kid at my school. Every test is 22 pages long of passages you don't understand because some company convinced the district a decade ago that phonics is bad actually and we need data data data. Then you have a writing test right after that with more passages you don't get and a full essay at the end. Then you have a reading test to get your new reading level, which isn't very high because you weren't taught phonics and people keep getting mad that your reading level has stalled exactly where research says it will with whole language learning at a 4th grade level. Then you get 3 weeks of teaching, in which time you have to have at least 2 quizzes and a long form writing piece before the next go round. Literally a quarter of your ELA class is testing. You can't read novels any more. Finally you get something you're enjoying, you love this new game that has you engaged in two subjects' standards--it gets cut off. Because your teacher says you have to take another quiz on top of the one you had to take two days ago. And this is with me blatantly not meeting expectations with pretests--doubling the amount of tests taken

Of course none of those tests matter. You had a 12 last year and didn't fail. You had a 24 the year before that. You had a 60 the year before that. You haven't enjoyed or passed school since 3rd grade with that teacher who was so old she just told admin to go fuck themselves. You don't know your teacher hates this too and will get fired if she tells you. You assume she's just a lazy bitch who hates her job. 

We're grown, and getting constantly nitpicked and found wanting is making 50% of us consider giving up our careers. Then we look at 12 year olds, many with disabilities both diagnosed and not, and wonder why they feel like giving up?",1649804515

I also kept the information for my own records incase I ever got asked. If something crazy happened, I would let the teacher know as well. But I typically just would walk around the room if they had an assignment, and try to prompt the kids to do it. If they said they were done, I'd ask to see, just to confirm.

If a note from a teacher said no food or drink, I would follow that. Just do what is said, and I was good.",1649803981

I wasn’t very rigid about requiring that students stay in seats, only that they didn’t interfere with other students. I understand that that may not be possible with many students, I was lucky to have smaller classes. I would sometimes motion to students that they take a quick run up and down the hallway (you will probably want to have a way of having their cell phone off them before they do this). They also need to understand that it’s a huge privilege, and that the first time they interfere with any other teacher’s class they lose it forever.

For yourself, you’ll probably want to have a way to check in with certain students before they have too much work missing. Once there’s too much to be done, even if you have a clear path for them to hand everything in, it will feel overwhelming and they may not be able to get started.

What happens then? I mean, we already hav a massive student debt crisis with the 1/3, and many college graduates are under employed and what they do get doesn’t cover enough to leave their parent’s house. 

What if we flooded the market with these graduates? Like, literally tripled the number in the workforce. What happens? How can they pay back those loans, how can they find gainful employment when they’ve reached their potential, yet so have the dozens of others crowding around that own job.

Sometimes, late at night, I am almost glad that not everyone at my school puts in that effort.

Another option (that is a lot of work and not possible for every lesson) would involve lots of different activities at different stations around the room. 

Basically, my suggestion is to break up the teacher at the front, mass of students at desks dynamic so that the conversations and groups of friends are also broken up. It’s easier to chat when the teacher feels distant, at the front of the room.

My last resort would be to just give them boring work to do on their devices, question and answer type of thing, so they get the basic knowledge that you need to impart on them. I would stop doing any teacher-led work and just supervise them while they work. Have them produce something by the end of each lesson (eg. Submit questions 1-10 via Google Classroom) and log their submissions. Failure to submit will be noted and three failures to submit ends with a letter to parents/detention, or some other outcome.

What now PBIS and all the other crap we are told to do instead of holding bad behaviors accountable? This teacher was good to the student. Had a good repertoire and still was treated thIs way.

This is what happens when severe behaviors and repeated offenders continue to get away with their bad behaviors. They snap and do something like this. I’m sure if we were to look at his files he’d have a wrap sheet a mile long that was ignored and admins that did nothing to protect their teachers. 

I had a first grader attack students on a field trip bus ride and I had to use my body to block him and he went off on me. I had bites, scratches, and bruises on my arms, neck and chest when I got to school and reported it the AP talked to him and sent him back to class an hour later. When I told the AP if I should fill out the referral form and add pictures of my injuries she literally laughed and said not to do that. I left that year.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusing\_Ourselves\_to\_Death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusing_Ourselves_to_Death)

&gt;Postman distinguishes the Orwellian vision of the future, in which totalitarian governments seize individual rights, from that offered by Aldous Huxley in Brave New World, where people medicate themselves into bliss, thereby voluntarily sacrificing their rights. Drawing an analogy with the latter scenario, Postman sees television's entertainment value as a present-day ""soma"", the fictitious pleasure drug in Brave New World, by means of which the citizens' rights are exchanged for consumers' entertainment.  
  
The essential premise of the book, which Postman extends to the rest of his argument(s), is that ""form excludes the content"", that is, a particular medium can only sustain a particular level of ideas. Thus rational argument, integral to print typography, is militated against by the medium of television for this reason. Owing to this shortcoming, politics and religion are diluted, and ""news of the day"" becomes a packaged commodity. Television de-emphasizes the quality of information in favor of satisfying the far-reaching needs of entertainment, by which information is encumbered and to which it is subordinate.  
  
Postman asserts the presentation of television news is a form of entertainment programming; arguing that the inclusion of theme music, the interruption of commercials, and ""talking hairdos"" bear witness that televised news cannot readily be taken seriously. Postman further examines the differences between written speech, which he argues reached its prime in the early to mid-nineteenth century, and the forms of televisual communication, which rely mostly on visual images to ""sell"" lifestyles. He argues that, owing to this change in public discourse, politics has ceased to be about a candidate's ideas and solutions, but whether he comes across favorably on television. Television, he notes, has introduced the phrase ""now this"", which implies a complete absence of connection between the separate topics the phrase ostensibly connects. Larry Gonick used this phrase to conclude his Cartoon Guide to (Non)Communication, instead of the traditional ""the end"".  
  
Postman refers to the inability to act upon much of the so-called information from televised sources as the information-action ratio. He contends that ""television is altering the meaning of 'being informed' by creating a species of information that might properly be called disinformation—misplaced, irrelevant, fragmented or superficial information that creates the illusion of knowing something but which in fact leads one away from knowing"".  
  
Drawing on the ideas of media scholar Marshall McLuhan – altering McLuhan's aphorism ""the medium is the message"" to ""the medium is the metaphor"" – he describes how oral, literate, and televisual cultures radically differ in the processing and prioritization of information; he argues that each medium is appropriate for a different kind of knowledge. The faculties requisite for rational inquiry are simply weakened by televised viewing. Accordingly, reading, a prime example cited by Postman, exacts intense intellectual involvement, at once interactive and dialectical; whereas television only requires passive involvement.  
  
Postman argues that commercial television has become derivative of advertising. Moreover, modern television commercials are not ""a series of testable, logically ordered assertions"" rationalizing consumer decisions, but ""is a drama—a mythology, if you will—of handsome people"" being driven to ""near ecstasy by their good fortune"" of possessing advertised goods or services. ""The truth or falsity of an advertiser's claim is simply not an issue"" because more often than not ""no claims are made, except those the viewer projects onto or infers from the drama."" Because commercial television is programmed according to ratings, its content is determined by commercial feasibility, not critical acumen. Television in its present state, he says, does not satisfy the conditions for honest intellectual involvement and rational argument.  
  
He repeatedly states that the eighteenth century, the ""Age of Reason"", was the pinnacle for rational argument. Only in the printed word, he states, could complicated truths be rationally conveyed. Postman gives a striking example: many of the first fifteen U.S. presidents could probably have walked down the street without being recognized by the average citizen, yet all these men would have been quickly known by their written words. However, the reverse is true today. The names of presidents or even famous preachers, lawyers, and scientists call up visual images, typically television images, but few, if any, of their words come to mind. The few that do almost exclusively consist of carefully chosen soundbites. Postman mentions Ronald Reagan, and comments upon Reagan's abilities as an entertainer.",1649799907

Only one substitute this year (and I've had a lot) has actually put her foot down and canceled a fun activity when everyone kept acting inappropriately.

74,i4hh2j4,t1_i4hdfe8,t3_u27tx8,Illogical_Fallacy,Teachers,"Powerpoint is definitely a simpler concept to how Canva design can be approached. Once you get into it, their templates and easily searchable image library saves you so much time.

So I'm currently an admin, so my day to day use of spreadsheets was essentially mandatory due to the sheer numbers of things and people I need to keep track of from hiring and everyday student management. I still used it just as much when teaching kindergarten, but in a different way, of course.

Searchable premade comments are certainly one way to utilize it. Btw, you can certainly make the boxes/text bigger and make multiline comments by either using the ""wrap text"" function or ctrl+enter.

One common way that I used was to make a template of my daily schedule for the week. Knowing what the schedule needs to be, including any cocurriculars and duties in an easily editable and sortable form is helpful. Columns: Time, subject, details. Rows: in whichever increment makes sense.

You can also set up conditional formatting to highlight cells however you want. I often color code things like when I'm on duty (conditional formatting &gt; if cells contain ""duty"" &gt; highlight yellow, etc).

Once you have a template week, just copy and edit as you need to for each week. Have a sub? Simply give them this sheet with an addendum sheet that explains what your norms are for each subject. While the daily agenda might simply say ""morning meeting,"" the addendum for subs would have additional information like any greeting songs, how to do attendance, the morning message process, other jobs, etc. That way, you can ensure that even if the sub is not familiar with the exact approach, they'd know what's generally meant to happen and the kids can fill in the gaps.

I also use sheets for mail merges. When you have lots of kids to make labels for, simply create a sheet with relevant information and use either the MS word built-in tools or Avery online label design tool. I often create pretty label designs on Canva, upload them into Avery, and use a mail merge to get every student their own label for their table spots, cubbies, etc.

Spreadsheets are also somewhat helpful to have set sizes for basic designs that can be scalable. We have two versions of a feelings chart (happy, sad, calm, mad) with two axes: energy and positive/negative emotion. While the basic four box version is super easy to make, we also have one that has 12 boxes with enriching vocabulary within each section. Once you design it, spreadsheets are great at automatically scaling them from letter to ledger size and so on. Then I'd have to make picture magnets to go along with them, and you've guessed it, Canva plus Avery plus mail merge.


There's lots of other ways to use them when you start including formulae and other shenanigans. Spreadsheets are life.",1649799676

The thin blue line still exists, and it’s a line with a lot of secrets. I’m lucky enough that I don’t have to worry about looking at a cop the wrong way (white, young, female) but others do. And the thin blue line often protects them, like those cops that knocked over that poor old man and then watched as blood pooled under his head. 
In low income communities and communities with more POC, it’s hard to even tell people that cops are good and on their side. Because a lot of them aren’t unfortunately.
There was that cop yelling at an already apprehended man, and when a younger cop grabbed his belt trying to say “that’s enough boss”, he grabbed her by the throat and screamed at her to not touch him.

However, there is more time to breathe and less micromanaging because it seems like no one fully understands what you do or exactly where you fit in the system, lol. It’s also completely possible to work contract hours and nothing more. There is a decent amount of autonomy and you still get to teach students and help everyone in the building.

They can really be valuable leading through this maze.     I would make a step to TFA and find out just what their priorities are in placements. They may be able to get you into a different position.  They keep changing things over the years, but I certainly would be reaching out to them.  

 Contract wise...    It's early in the next year process..  At this point, I would guess you could walk aways from the contract with minimal to no repercussions.   The district might buffoon you around, but, it's a next year contract and people do walk after signing.  Again, if you are in a union state with a strong union all of this might be taken care of on their advice and wisdom.  

There are all sorts of jobs out there.   Not all are teaching, but, if you wish to stay more or less in that field...  you could look into the online for profit schools.  They are nationwide and use only certified teachers from that state you will be teaching in.    You could set up a tutor business and get your ""card"" out there.

With how the climate is looking, chances are things aren’t going to be “nice” or alive like they are now. Most coral is supposed to be dead in 15-20 years. 

With how politics are, things are getting more polarizing. The people on the other side of the aisle might think you’re a horrible subhuman thing no matter what side you’re on. It’s hard to agree on some things and disagree on others. It’s all or nothing and becoming more and more savage. 

With how late stage capitalism is, it’s just depressing. Things are getting more and more expensive while people are generally earning less and less. You see it all the time on this sub. I don’t know anyone who buys anything new, and those that do are usually broke most of the month. The economy is constantly hanging by a thread. There are so many economic bubbles it feels like you’re at a childrens birthday party waiting for them to pop. 

We’ve also had a big push for people to go onto college as the only thing after high school when this isn’t the case. It’s now “go to college or head over to Walmart” sort of thing where if you don’t go you’re gonna be stuck in a dead end job. That’s the after high school planning that’s left. 

The world is a depressing place and there’s not much to look forward to. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to afford a home or to ever get a car that’s younger than 10 years old and I’m older than my students!

81,i4hdx5k,t3_u25cvs,t3_u25cvs,holy_shit_history,Teachers,"This brings to mind a wonderful quote from Neil Postman's *Amusing Ourselves to Death*:

""We were keeping our eye on 1984. When the year came and the prophecy didn’t, thoughtful Americans sang softly in praise of themselves. The roots of liberal democracy had held. Wherever else the terror had happened, we, at least, had not been visited by Orwellian nightmares.

But we had forgotten  that alongside Orwell’s dark vision, there was another—slightly older, slightly  less well known, equally chilling: Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World. Contrary to  common belief even among the educated, Huxley and Orwell did not prophesy the  same thing. Orwell warns that we will be overcome by an externally imposed  oppression.   
But in Huxley’s vision, no Big Brother is required to deprive  people of their autonomy, maturity and history. As he saw it, people will come to love their oppression, to adore the technologies that undo their capacities to think.

What Orwell feared  were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no  reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell  feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would  give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism. Orwell feared    
that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be  drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive  culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some  equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and   
the centrifugal bumblepuppy. As Huxley remarked in Brave New World Revisited, the civil libertarians and  rationalists who are ever on the alert to oppose tyranny “failed to take into  account man’s almost infinite appetite for distractions.” In 1984, Huxley  added, people are   
controlled by inflicting pain. In Brave New World, they are  controlled by inflicting pleasure. In short, Orwell feared that what we hate  will ruin us. Huxley feared that what we love will ruin us.""",1649798448

English they at least practice somewhat on a daily basis, so I don't know if I'm comparing apples to apples here.  I just know that the practice of pushing people up expecting them to just catch up the next year is flawed. 

The other side of this is the social stigma around holding students back.  On the one hand it can be discouraging, but I would argue getting to high school where you have no idea what's going on in a bunch of your classes will cause much more anxiety (and at a more volatile stage of development).

45,i4hb7kh,t3_u27tx8,t3_u27tx8,antipodal_edu,Teachers,"High school, humanities:

1. Collaborate with team members to share the planning load. If this isn't an option, try to get your department to buy one. Failing that, figure out how much time it would take you to make it, divide that by the cost of the curriculum, and see if you'd be happy to pay that much to have those hours of your life be your own. Not ideal, but probably worth it in most cases. 
2. Comment banks. I don't use it as much anymore (see below) but I set up a Stream Deck for most of my major assignments a few years ago, so it was quite easy to flit through and slap down comments with the push of a few buttons as I read. You can also just copy/paste from a Word doc to the side; an external monitor with decent resolution is something I consider essential for most marking.
3. Scale back your written feedback. I used to do too much, I now realise how much I'm already giving in class verbally. Lots of them don't even read it anyways; if they want more/clarification they are always welcome to come to me for more specifics. On the whole, be more general and put more of the cognitive load on them (will help them learn more anyways), eg don't tell them how to spell a word, just circle it, write ""fix"" or a question mark next to a poorly-worded sentence instead of giving a suggestion, etc.
4. For large tasks (research projects, essays, etc), collect a draft midway through and give written feedback on that rather than the final one, which gets a grade only. Technically not less work\*, but lets you distribute your marking load more evenly instead of having it all come due at the end of the term. Also far more useful for the kids.
5. Have a dummy laptop for playing videos, and set up with your real one at the back of the room (can still see all the kids, they can't see you) and get work done when there's a doco/film to show. I know you can extend your screen, but somtimes weird things happen with opening new browser windows, etc. 
6. Learn to touch type if you can't already. I took a keyboarding class in Year 8 (and grew up gaming online in the age of dial-up, so no VoIP) so I'm a pretty fast and accurate typist. It's a skill that pays dividends over your whole life. Also very useful for writing emails while actively monitoring the class; when the kids notice I'm doing it it blows their minds, lol
7. General rule of thumb from psychology: variable ratio reinforcement gets the highest number of desired behaviours for the least amount of input (basically, positive/negative reinforcement after a random number of repetitions of the behaviour). You can use this in a few ways:

* collecting everything and only mark sometimes
* every now and then, give a reward out of the blue for kids doing the right thing. I've got a bunch of Cadbury eggs that all the kids wearing their masks properly are gonna get tomorrow.
* behaviour: tell the kids you'll put a log in the system (good, bad, or ugly) for 4-5 students in the class at the end of the lesson, but don't tell them the students who the 4-5 are until the end

&amp;#x200B;

\*In practice it is less work, because the kids who can't be arsed won't hand it in for a comment if there's no grade at stake, which means you can just copy/paste a ""***I am disappointed you have not submitted this draft as an opportunity to receive feedback in advance of the final submission next week. I am now concerned you may not submit the final version on time.***"" in the comment field and be free as a bird. Also puts the kid on blast early, and since parents can see it they have much less wiggle room to come at me for non-submitted, late, or plagiarised work.

I do redirect, at least once per student. I remind them to put their devices away. I try to do it in a friendly-but-firm manner.

I am a *lot* firmer with kids who are disrupting the learning of others, but if it's just their own learning they're neglecting, I figure that *I don't know them well enough to push*. A lot of high school kids are reading at a third grade level, or they don't understand the math concept, or they're so accustomed to failing that if I walk in and start pushing I'm going to get a LOT of pushback and in possibly unsafe ways.

My goal is a room that is under control enough that individual students can focus on their work and I can offer assistance to the kids who are willing to receive it. 

When I see a kid is on their phone, I'll come over and remind them, ""No phones until your work is done, can I help you get started on your assignment?""

Their parents have caused such an imbalance that is carried with the student into the classrooms when it comes to technology. Ranging from tablets, laptops, cell phones, etc etc. Now, post covid, everyone has switched over to the google chrome books which give kids access to the world wide web. Go guardian? Yeah, good luck, proximity, pffft...

Parents have not taught them the proper way to cope with their feelings and have handed them a hand held device to, in essence, ""shut them up"". Sadly, I see this EVERYWHERE, grocery stores, babies will have cell phones, 2nd graders will have cell phones, therefore detaching them from reality. 

Another big fucking irritating issue that I see whenever I've pushed into the hundreds of classrooms throughout the years, is the lack of continuity and consistency amongst the staff/admin. They don't stand united against any of this shit. Admin might be more lenient, one teacher might enforce the cell phone policy, another might not. I think about the message that sends to the students and it's basically, ""im going to do whatever I want, because so and so allowed me too"" 

grrrr, sorry, i went off on a tangent here haha. I'm glad you're in your student teaching so you can see firsthand what you have coming up in the future... I'm almost done with my schooling and will be transition from TA to Teacher.

I did two years of AmeriCorps as I was transitioning careers and think fondly on those times and less fondly on my finances back then.

I teach HS Math. I assess formative exit tickets at the end of new content lessons, formative quizzes at half-way or third-way points in a unit, and the summative Test.

I do not grade nor assign homework anymore. I do assign practice problems. I reserve roughly half of our time for practice problems. Anything that isn't done I recommend that students do at home but I do not require it, nor do I check for completion or correctness. Answer keys are available for students to check themselves. I'm available for questions during that time.

The only thing that is useful to assign are things we will talk about. I will answer questions about the practice problems. After a quiz or test we spend a whole day going over the answers and the misconceptions I noticed. Exit tickets are reviewed the next day as well. In general if you don't want to look at it closely then DON'T assign it.

I have 30 minutes before school, a 1 hour prep period, and 30 minutes after school in my contract to grade/prepare/print/etc. I find time during class too. I'm active on reddit today because it's a quiz day. I don't assign anything that I can't get graded by the next day. If you don't have time to grade it within your contract day then DON'T assign it.

You can change how you plan or execute lessons, but I would really suggest that you let go of this battle and channel your energy into supporting students who will give you some amount of effort.  When a student puts for no effort/is just sitting their on their phone, I will give 1-2 nonverbal cues such as a simple tap on their desk, and then if nothing changes I will say quietly to them, “Are you ready to start working on [task]?”  Maybe I will call or email home 1-2x and say “I’ve noticed Johnny is on his phone a lot during class and it’s distracting him from getting his work done.”  Aaaaand that’s about it.  I have a clipboard with a roster and I’ll make a note of the attempted redirection.  I print a new roster each week and file away the previous weeks’.  Then, if or when admin ever gets on my case, I can just say, “Here’s where I documented the behavior and attempted to redirect, here’s when I called home.” 

You gotta pick your battles.  Don’t waste time and energy on students who won’t meet you halfway.  Don’t work harder for them then they will work for themselves.  Your job is to teach.  It’s not to entertain, put on a show, or parent.  I’m not saying you should “give up” on these students, but this problem is bigger than you and if you want to stay in this field you will have to learn which battles are worth fighting, and this isn’t one of them.

Our high school students don't see a future, nor do they see their place in it.

Couple that with the idea that society is putting out there that if something is hard or hurts you(not physically), you don't have to do it, you get where we are now.

Students don't see what the next step is, so they don't work hard to get there. 

Do I think that phones and screen time plays a part... maybe but I feel like people said that about TV too (I know it's different because you can't ant bring a TV with you)  but I would venture to guess the self esteem movement in the mid 80's to early 90's is playing a bigger part, in that you always need to feel good about yourself in almost a toxic way, makes it really hard to admit you don't know something.

Collective bargaining is tied directly to ability to strike in the longrun, bargaining requires leverage and the only leverage in schools tends to be work stoppage and the loss of ADA.

Find a way to adjust your curriculum so you have time IN CLASS to grade and do paperwork, even if it's just an extra 10-15 minutes. If you teach secondary, this can add up each period and completely replace your need to stay late or grade at home. Admins stress bell-to-bell instructions but fuck that. What do they know?",1649793176

Mostly though, I've been teaching the same subject for a few years. I can get everything I need done in a couple prep hours per week. I only stay late 2x a year for report cards because I prefer to get them done in big batches.",1649793103
