1,i4miyr3,t3_u2zrje,t3_u2zrje,Still_Strangest,Parenting,"It‚Äôs so devastating to hear those words even when you know they don‚Äôt really mean them. My child was very similar at that age and for a while beyond. We had a major crisis that she was thrust into and when she would scream at me I knew it was because she was so angry and frustrated with the situation, but couldn‚Äôt change any of it. I knew in my heart that she would only scream at me because I was her safe person and subconsciously she knew she could let her big feelings out with me and I would still be there and love her. 

That said, it‚Äôs still so hard to step back and not take what‚Äôs said personally, but also to see your child in this pain and not be able to fix it right in that moment. We worked hard at trying to develop coping strategies and work at emotional regulation when she was not upset, which helped a lot in the aftermath of the tantrum but not so much in the midst of it when their brains just can‚Äôt be rational. One of her favourites is hot chocolate breath. Basically deep breathing, first you take a big sniff of the delicious hot chocolate, then you do a nice long slow breath to blow on it and cool it off so you can drink it. Sometimes she‚Äôs so angry I have to leave the room, but I make sure to let her know I will be close by if she calls or is ready snuggles (a sign she‚Äôs starting to wind down). Then I do my own deep breathing for a bit in the hall.

You sound like you are doing all the right things honestly. These are big overwhelming feelings for them and you are doing awesome trying to help her name and understand them. It‚Äôs tricky to do and honestly my child hated me trying to name her feelings out loud and it would make her scream more. One of the therapists we saw suggested instead of commenting about her feelings to make it about me when describing the feelings, so instead of ‚ÄúYou are feeling so angry right now!‚Äù I would say something like ‚ÄúI can see that your eyes are all scrunched up and your arms are crossed, when my body looks like that it‚Äôs because I feel so angry.‚Äù I also really found some value in listening to some of the talks Dan Siegel has given on emotional regulation and kids. Especially‚ÄúName It to Tame It‚Äù which you can find on YouTube. He has a book and everything too, but sometimes it hard to actually sit down and read when your in the midst of all this. 

I wouldn‚Äôt worry about any lasting effects on her, she‚Äôs learning how to manage and regulate her emotions and at that age it‚Äôs so hard. You are her safe place to let everything out. I would however make sure that you are trying to find the support you need because it sounds like you are feeling this deep in your heart right now and that‚Äôs so difficult. Do you do therapy or have a friend or family member that you can lean on to listen while you let your feelings out? Someone who can remind you that even though you feel hurt and this is hard, that you are an awesome mom and are doing your best. Those supports to help pick you back up when you get knocked down are crucial to being able to get back in there and be able to continue helping your daughter back up. Eventually it will get better, but until it does finding ways to emotionally step back during the moment and vent or recharge afterwards will be vital to being able to continue dealing with the tantrums. 

I‚Äôm sorry your going through this, it‚Äôs so hard. I wish you continued strength and hopefully quieter nights very soon.",1649888654

If she's not ready for potty training stop. Or change how you're training. The way I did it was day 1 every 15 minutes I put them on the toilet. Day 2 every 30 minutes and I would ask around the 15 minute mark. Day 3 I would ask at 30 minutes and take them on the hour. If they used the potty they got an M&amp;M if they had an accident we cleaned it up. Day 4+ I would ask every hour if they had an accident we went back to every 15 minutes for the rest of the day. They hated every 15 minutes because they couldn't play all day. Took about 2 weeks to be 90% good. After that accidents were accidents.

For bed we said if they weren't sleepy then they could get up but had to stay in their room. For a couple days they did but it wasn't fun being by themselves and they stopped.

For the juice I would say ""you spit juice so no more juice today, only water."" If they do it again now only water at the table. Don't react just give a natural consequence. The next day I would say ""before I give you your juice what is the rule?"" Get them to say something like ""no spitting."" Then say ""what happens if you do spit?"" Get them to say ""no more juice.""

I agree that sharing work is the *expected* thing, but we're not all perfect and the most important thing for you to do is make your family function. If your husband doesn't want to do his chores and you already had a talk and he still doesn't want to do it then arguing isn't going to help. Try to find a solution. Ask him if he has any ideas, with the baseline being that you are not going to do extra chores either.

My kid is only 1,5years so I haven't experienced the same (yet), but as I read it's a normal phase of child development. Also sleep regressions occur once in a while. I read that if our kid calls us ""The worst mom in the world who would better be dead"" it's very hurtful but we should take it as a compliment. it's a sign for a secure relationship. Your child feels safe to show you her darkest feelings because she knows that you will love her no matter what. A child with a less secure relationship, will not dare to say something like that because it's afraid it might loose it's parents love. (Which obviously doesn't mean that kids who never call their parents names have all less secure relationships with their parents. Different children have different temperaments. And I read the temperament isn't a product of wrong education but mostly genetically predetermined. I read most of it from Nora Imlau, she's a German author and writes about children which experience very strong emotions. I don't know if her books are also published in english.)

As I already said you are doing a good job handling the tantrums explaining emotions and so on. One sentence I read when facing insults by our children is: ""I still love you, even if you despise me at the moment. I will always love you and we will get through this is(strong emotions) together.

Maybe you find an appropriate child's book which explains how to experience and deal with anger? 
Maybe you can plan during the daytime how to better handle the anger. Maybe punching or screaming in a pillow? Or maybe you find someone else to blame? Maybe the ""anger"" or the situation itself? Or if to abstract you could just imagine a name? How about ""Thanks Obama"" :D

I did it because I wanted them to be a bit more independent and able to leave me (both my kids are stage 5 clingers).

But I don‚Äôt think, academically it made a huge difference- my current preschooler is reading already, but i give credit to her AMAZING teacher, more than just because she went to school itself.

He looked flustered but said no problem and got a mop.  I moved my cart to the front desk and told the nice older ladies what happened.  Left the cart to get him cleaned up in the car, came back and it was all good.  Went back to shopping.

As long as you're not being a jerk and just leaving a puddle or shit somewhere without notifying someone, I think you're okay.  Seriously, stuff happens and your kid leaving a puddle is not that bad in the world of retail and cleaning up other people's mess.

""Hi my girls, so dad and I have some news we need to share with you. Grandma ( name) has died. We wanted to tell you so we can talk about our feelings and what this means..""

Avoid euphemisms to avoid confusion. If they were close, there will be tears and that's okay. Your goal is  knowing they understand and sharing feelings to process the loss. You may need to involve a therapist, you may not. It depends on the child individually.

Often with the first experience of death there is a new fear of losing a parent or someone else close to the child. This is normal and the best thing you can do is reassure them that you have no intention of going anywhere and plan to be around for a long time. Kids are pretty resilient but if you notice changes in behaviour, excessive crying over a long period,  acting out of character even unprovoked anger... it might be a good time to get a therapist on board to help your kids process their grief and loss.",1649884879

Prepare mentally, get resources in order, tell him you want a divorce. If he won't leave the house, have a plan and leave with your son RIGHT AFTER THAT CONVO.

Asking others is a good idea to gain perspective, but YOUR INSTINCTS ARE CORRECT, and IT IS OKAY TO LISTEN TO THEM. Even if that's the only reason for a divorce, it is enough for a divorce in your case. Get you and your son free. Good luck, reach out if you need it.",1649884726

As far as the social aspect is concerned, I'm not sure that it can really be done as well in other ways. Even if you make a conscious effort to bring your son on frequent play dates, that isn't really comparable to spending all day, every day learning how to appropriately socialize with his peers.

If I had the opportunity to be a stay at home parent or work part time I would have taken it in a heartbeat, but we depend on my income. I really really struggled coming back to work after my first. I've felt what you are feeling. I felt so inadequate in every area. But now I've settled into a more comfortable headspace. I took a position in my company with less responsibility when I was pregnant with my second (I basically have a very simple office job now). It's not competitive, I'm not vying for a promotion or anything, so I don't have that additional pressure. I don't hesitate to take time off for my kids and I do my best to leave work at work. I'm good at what I do, I'm earning my paycheck, but I've learned not to stress about the extra stuff or let work get in my head. (This did not happen overnight, it took a long time to get in this mindset.)
And you cannot compare yourself to other moms. Everyone's situation is different and if your child doesn't have a designer styled birthday party, they would probably never know the difference. It's about quality, making the time to make special memories on the weekends like simple picnics and playing games.
It's taken me years to finally feel like I'm doing a pretty good job as a mom, as a wife, and as an employee.

I would also suggest picking up the book, The Explosive Child, by Ross Greene. This book was a serious eye opener for me. My third child would have bouts of anger and negative self talk and seemed to be more sensitive than his peers.

Still happens a bit (she is now 4.5), but much more infrequently. At the worst of it (starting at about 2 years old, at the start of the pandemic), she'd wake every 45 minutes, all night long. Sometimes she settled right away after, sometimes she was up for an hour. We worked with a specialist to improve sleep habits, which helped a bit. The thing that helped the most, though, was melatonin (which I resisted using FOREVER, but then the night terrors started every 20 minutes and I threw in the towel). And it helped her catch up on her sleep deficit, which then improved the night terrors. (We weaned her off of it after about 6 months.) Something else that helped was more quality time as a family, which had been disrupted because of our own anxiety from the pandemic. So essentially, in our case, it was very related to anxiety in the home (which was obviously exacerbated by the night terrors!), and a sleep deficit (ibid).

In my experience kids deal with death much better than we do. I've seen it in friends' kids and my own. They're so much more Now than we are. They don't get so overwhelmed by the prospect of ""never again"", maybe because they haven't constructed the future and can't really grasp the concept as much? Or maybe because in their young lives so many things are new discoveries, new ideas all the time, they seem to just roll with it and accept things. You know?

My brother, who was living with us, died very unexpectedly when my kids were 2.5 and 5.5. They didn't really understand right away. They were most upset because it happened in the night before my birthday, so my birthday was ""cancelled"" and they thought that was the worst thing possible. I explained his death to them honestly, couched in my beliefs about the meaning of things. They asked simple questions at first (why didn't he take his stuff? Can we still call him? What about his promise to xyz with us? Won't he be lonely without us?) and bigger, deeper questions over time. They were busy with the topic for a few months, processing. They cried. They missed him. They talked to him. And they let it go. No scars, no fears in the long run. They learnt that death is a normal part of life and accepted that. They still remember him and talk about him 3 years later, which warms my heart and is as it should be.

I'm sorry you and your SO have to soldier through your daughter's bday holding in your grief. These are the hardest parts of parenting, keeping it together for them when you're not okay. I'd say have the talk the next day, perhaps even tie the birthday into the cycle of life conversation, and don't be afraid.

Your 20 mo could really enjoy having just some mommy and me time in the evenings - maybe your wife and youngest could plan to do something fun together on the Saturday or one evening while you are gone? That way both kids get a fun week with a parent, doing activities that are age appropriate and won't be too overwhelming for you. 

(My personal experience - I am the oldest of 4 and I really wish I had more chances to make one on one memories with either of my parents. Having to contend with really small kids on trips and always be the ""helper"" or the ""one who can keep themselves occupied"" led to me really resenting family vacations after awhile. I think family trips can be great, but if every step is designed around trying to make it ok with the 20 mo (which it would have to be when you are outnumbered!) and is dependant upon the 3.5 year old being well behaved, eventually the eldest will notice and simply have less fun (or even rebel for attention...I definitely did after a few of these types of trips). My husband is an oldest child too and had the same experience, so much so that we purposely plan to take our kids on separate trips with one parent regularly.

People who have children that eat on their own don't understand the fight all day every day to get something into your child. It's exhausting. But like I said, it's gotten slowly better with my kids. Keep your head up. :)",1649880675

Being just a little more price conscious, including aldi in the regular shopping and only getting a handful of things from wegmans, buying less meat, and going for the budget friendly fruits and vegetables and fruits (while still buying local and farmer's markets) we're bringing that to closer to 1,000 a month.  We're hopeful the garden this summer and the crop share will knock that down a little more too.

If we dropped all of those preferences and just aimed to get a variety of healthy and nutritious food and leaned into the rice and beans and white carbs just a little (and shopped at aldi and wallmart exclusively) I'm positive I could make it closer to 400-500 a month.  If we lived like I did in college I could bring the bill even lower.

The way we currently shop spending 1000-1200 a month is 100% a luxury and we recognize it is as such.  And there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.

A good common ground would be that since he still lives with you, that it is basic courtesy to let you know via phone or text if he will not be home/be home very late so you do not have to worry. Same as you would do for him, right?

On the flip side, would you rather he sleep at his GF's house and have sex, or go out to some party, get wasted, and drive home, potentially killing himself or others?

You can set boundaries on what you allow in your house but he's also an adult. You've done your job of raising him, now you need to start giving him room to be the adult you raised. You also need to make sure you don't push him out of your lives.

Well, there's your problem. Variable reinforcement (where most of the time it's ""no"" but sometimes it's ""yes"") will reinforce an undesired behavior much, much more strongly.  Say it takes your average kid 5 tantrums to get over not getting a toy.  If you give in on the 5th tantrum, they'll realize, ""Hey, it worked!"" and the next few times it might not work but *it will work* at some point, they just need to keep screaming. And now it's not 5 tantrums, it's 10 before they get over it.  Get earplugs, if needed. But DO NOT GIVE IN. Yes, this is a fucking hard ask. But raising a good child is a fucking hard job. And maybe, by tantrum 15, they'll realize that this time, it's for real. 

But I also think that, if they're just screaming in a bid to get their way, then you might be better served with just calmly ignoring it until they stop, and then moving on, without discussing it. Kids this age are not meta-cognitive; they don't really know whys and wherefores. They know they want something, they know they didn't get it--and now here you are, reminding them again that there was something they wanted but didn't get, and OMG Emotions.

You‚Äôre letting him live there, as an adult man. He‚Äôs not some inmate who has been placed in your custody.

You can have rules that govern your property and the use of it without governing his property (his person). For example, you can say that he‚Äôs not allowed to paint the walls, hang things, or have pets. These things directly impact your property. You can‚Äôt tell him he‚Äôs not allowed to leave or come back during certain period of time because it doesn‚Äôt impact your property - it impacts his. 

You‚Äôre falling into the classic parenting trap. You‚Äôre using your position of power over him - in this case being his landlord who provides free housing - to coerce him into doing things that you view to be correct.

Especially with school starting.  If you think the things you're arguing about now are bad, just wait until you want to sign your son up for T-Ball and have to inform him of the schedule with 50% of the games and practices on ""his"" time.  

You may not even have to actually go to court.  Send him an outline of what you'd like to be in the plan.  Google sample plans and get an idea of what's covered and what isn't covered.  It he refuses, try again.  If he refuses again, then just have your attorney schedule a date for a custody hearing.  Chances are you won't even have to go!  Just having a date on the calendar is likely to spur him to actually negotiate and resolve this stuff.  I really don't think you have anything to worry about in court.

88,i4lrrkr,t3_u2rsja,t3_u2rsja,BronwynLane,Parenting,"OP, I‚Äôm so sorry you &amp; your son are going through this. I was groomed at 21 by a 33 year old. It took me *ten years* to be able to recognize I was groomed because one of the primary factors of grooming is that the person being groomed believes they‚Äôre acting consensually and are an equal part of the relationship. You may feel like, at 18, you made the decisions you did fully aware (and okay with) the age gap. This isn‚Äôt not-true, but there is more here. There are power dynamics (age, gender, confidence, experience, maturity) that disrupt the balance of responsibility and consent. For those 10 years I believed what happened was my fault, because I believed I was equally responsible. I wasn‚Äôt. And neither are you. PTSD is paralyzing (at least for me) and very confusing.

Our bodies clue into things that are not comfortable as a natural warning of danger. Your body is alerting you to this. You should always trust this. Especially in a relationship where the other person has already been abusive. You are not paranoid, you are not over reacting. Your son is in danger. I can‚Äôt imagine hearing a scarier sentence than that.

Now, what can you do?

Are you not sure if you want to or can leave?
‚Äî Seek support. See a therapist virtually. Contact a domestic violence / women‚Äôs shelter. If you‚Äôre US based there are YWCA‚Äôs around the country, or you can use domesticshelters.org to find something local. *You do not have to decide to leave him before getting support.* There is support for you now, right as things are. However, do not under any circumstances let him know you are seeking or getting support. Private browsers, delete records, make calls from a landline or alternative phone. Ensure he does not have access to your Reddit. Password protect everything. Hide everything.

Do you know you want to leave?
‚Äî it is *very* important to have everything in order before doing so. You and your son will be at the greatest height of danger when, and immediately after, you leave. **He can never know what you‚Äôre planning, or when you leave.** You will need to literally disappear with your son, take only what is necessary (important documents, whatever finances you can secretly come up with, limited clothes/items). Seek the support mentioned above, they will assist you with safety, planning, finances, custody, etc. If you have a job, do not return to it. If you regularly visit places, never do again. If you have friends and family, do not tell them where you are. Stay at a shelter (further away the better), or with someone *distant* that he does not know about. Great uncle‚Äôs ex wife? Yes. Friend from middle school you‚Äôve never mentioned? Yes. Friend of a close friend? Cousin of a cousin? Old coworker that he never met? Yes. Yes. Yes. If they‚Äôre in your life, or are known to be past close people - they are not safe to be with, he will find you. If you have a car, don‚Äôt drive it in the area. Get a different cell phone number (and account of shared). If you need to contact family or friends, tell them you‚Äôre okay but do not give them clues to where you are.

Dear OP, this all requires strength and fortitude. It may feel impossible. All of it will be easier than staying with someone who hurts you &amp; your son.",1649877706

My kiddo was born at 32 weeks due to placental abruption. She didn't have a suckle reflex and struggled to learn to eat. She also had trouble breathing and was on high flow oxygen until the day before she went home (we were setup to take her home on oxygen). Due to her feeding issues, we spent 3 months in the NICU trying to get her to eat. We eventually had to have a g-tube placed which allowed us to take her home. It took her 2 years to figure out eating on her own. She is 5 years old now and the NICU is a distant memory.

We seem to have mostly come out the other side, though I am SURE he is getting away with some lies.  But the benchmark I set for what success would look like, is that he admits difficult truths.  Success is not ""never lies,"" because we ALL tell white lies sometimes, we all have the urge to avoid getting in trouble or disappointing people.  You'll never eliminate that fully, so make success be ""admits difficult truths.""

Example, this morning I heard the dog barking.  As I walked into the room, I heard a toy wood magic staff kid had made, hit the ground.  Dog and kid bolted in different directions.  From experience, I know that kid was shaking the stick around dog to get a reaction out of dog, something we forbid.  I didn't ask a question, I said ""You were bugging the dog with your staff, and threw it when you heard me coming.""  He said ""I didn't hear you coming, but ... that is what I was doing.""  I said thank you for the honesty, reminded him that the responsibility he had to show to have the staff was not hurting or scaring anyone (including the dog) with it, and moved on.  

There are some unique facets of ADHD that contribute to lying, so I would recommend looking into it from an ADHD perspective specifically.  I like ADDitude Magazine and find their articles to be generally well-sourced and good advice.  [Here are some resources they offer on lying.](https://www.additudemag.com/tag/lying/)

I would ease up on both the punishments and especially the shaming or forecasting of your disapproval.  You're not wrong in terms of how you would assign less credibility to a child with a history of lying, but explaining it that was is probably hurting more than helping.  And I don't think, at all, you mean to be shaming in the way you approach it, but I think it sort of inherently is.  Especially to someone as sensitive as kids with ADHD often are.

Some techniques I can suggest, based on suggestions from my kid's psychologist that I have flushed out further in the way that we used them that has been successful for us:

1. Eliminate opportunities to lie.

Don't ask questions, make statements.  As parents I think we reflexively, when we think our child missed brushing their teeth, ask ""Did you brush your teeth?"" but try to avoid that.  If you think she didn't brush her teeth, just ask her to brush her teeth.  If she says she did and you think that she is lying, you can say something like ""Okay, and that was very fast so let's go do it together.  Remember the dentist says to brush for a full 2 minutes!  Will you set the timer or will I?""  

This is sort of the second technique in eliminating opportunities to lie: Avoid debating.  If you don't believe her just find a way around it.  By asking fewer questions and moving forward with whatever thing regardless of the lie, you are reducing the number of times she will experience getting away with or having a positive outcome from lying.  You don't have to tell her you don't believe her, in fact it works better if you don't.  This worked so well on my kid that for awhile he would follow me around the house brushing his teeth so that we would all know without a doubt the teeth got brushed - this was fine with me.  (In general, kids with ADHD can get stuck in an argument/logic vortex and you end up having a longer back and forth with them about something that is ideal, so minimize debate and keep moving forward.)

By avoiding debating and just moving forward, you are also essentially ignoring the lie.  Water the flowers not the weeds.  You will get more of what you pay attention to.  Attention, even negative attention, is stimulation and ADHD kids crave it.  So if lying results in stimulation and feedback and a long back and forth, they won't lie on purpose to get that, but it works against trying to reduce the lying.

One more thing is don't focus on fault when you don't have to.  Recently-ish my kid was flipping the remote around playing with it, and he missed catching it.  It hit the ground, batteries popped out, 1 got lost and the battery cover cracked.  I didn't focus on fault at all when I found it - ""Oh no the remote is broken.  How can we fix it?""  And then he suggested duct tape to secure the batteries.  ""One battery is lost, what should we do?""  He looked for it, couldn't find it, so suggested he take a battery out of a toy.  I didn't give him the opportunity or incentive to lie, but I promise that still helps address the underlying behavior (playing with the remote).  And, when you avoid focusing on fault, you reduce incentive to lie while also making it seem safer to tell the truth.

2. Catch her telling the truth and give that reinforcement

Really widen your definition of what honesty looks like.  If you have cookies in the pantry and you typically limit cookies, but she asks you for one before school, you sort of have two broad choices.  Most parents, I think, would say ""No Sally, you know that we don't eat cookies before school.  You know that!"" and they wouldn't be wrong per se.  But what I do is treat that as the moment of honesty it is ""Thank you for being honest in asking for the cookie rather than just grabbing it.  I can't say yes to it but I can cut up some strawberries for you"" (or whatever other appropriate but desirable option you can offer).  

See, in my home at least, my kid could have just taken the cookies and quietly eaten them and put the wrapper in the trash and I never would have known.  I only have one, but in your case she might even leave the wrapper out and you'll say ""Who ate these cookies?"" and then you've given her a chance to lie.  So when my kid asks me if he can have a cookie, rather than give him a negative reaction to even asking, I treat that as honesty.  He asked when he DID know I'd probably say no, but he asked.  Imagine your child as a teenager, they have to decide whether to sneak out or whether to ask you to go to Betty's house.  You at least want them to ASK right?  Maybe you have to say no, but you have the chance to find a do-able compromise if one is possible.  Maybe you can say yes to going to Betty's for 1 hour and then pick her up, or something.  

One day I brought home a little treat for my kid after I'd been out with friends.  When I gave it to him he was so happy but said ""Oh no, I already had my after dinner snack.""  I asked what he had - nothing too unhealthy.  I thanked him for his honesty and let him have the treat anyway.  You can't always do that, but when you can, you create this 'bank' of memories and experiences where telling the truth had positive outcomes and so it's less scary.

So show some appreciation for every moment of honesty that you can.  If she didn't do her chores but she admitted it, focus on thanking her for the truth more than correcting her for missing the chores.  ""Thanks for telling me, I appreciate your honesty.  Now it's time to empty the dishwasher.""  

3. Impulse control

In general, you can work on impulse control.  Games are great for this - one we have been playing is Taco Cat Goat Cheese Pizza where you have to separate what your eyes see from what your mouth says, and exercise impulse control.  Simon Says and Mother May I work on impulse control.  Find ways to strengthen that impulse control 'muscle' because it contributes to lying v. truth telling.

The big one is [You should have asked](https://english.emmaclit.com/2017/05/20/you-shouldve-asked/) by Emma.  This is a great way to explain the mental load and all of the work you're doing even when you delegate something like that.  I've someone actually spell it out directly in the following way.

Doing a chore doesn;t just require the energy of doing it.  Instead there are 3 steps to the process

1) noticing the chore needs to be done

2) planning on when to do that chore

3) Actually doing the chore.

When you delegate a task to your husband he's not taking over all three steps.  Instead he's only taking care of the third step in the process and doesn't worry about those first two steps.  And not only that, but you now have to add a fourth step to the process when you delegate

4) Follow up to make sure the chore is done.

Assigning a chore only adds more to your mental load while it saves some small amount of the physical effort required.  Working through this requires a real conversation with him to help you both understand everything that's going on in the process and actually even distributing the mental load and not just making you the office manager that has to be in charge of everything that happens in the house.

Another article that really helps put this into words is [she divorced me because i left the dishes by the sink](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/she-divorced-me-i-left-dishes-by-the-sink_b_9055288).

Good touch would be something that makes you comfortable, like asking for a hug, a high five, a pat on the back. These require consent. 

A bad touch of course is anything that makes you uncomfortable. 

A *safe* touch can be different depending on situation but is done to keep you safe and healthy, like giving your child a bath, pulling/pushing them out of harms way. 

An UNSAFE touch would be violent behavior like a man/woman being abusive to their partner and/or kids. 

We teach kids that a good touch makes us feel comfortable, anything that makes us uncomfortable is a bad touch. 

I‚Äôve always told LO that NOBODY is ever allowed to see or touch their private body parts and they‚Äôre not allowed to see or touch anybody else‚Äôs private body parts. We have explained that the ONLY exception is mom and dad because we need to help LO wipe after using the toilet, or help give them a shower but eventually we still stop too and we only see/touch their private body parts to keep them safe and clean/healthy.

People should ask us and respect our decision for what we want. This is called Setting Boundaries. By setting boundaries **we** get to decide how people treat us, and you (as the parent) decide how people treat your kids. 

As parents we need to respect our children and their decisions and we need to help teach them to be comfortable setting boundaries for how other kids (and grownups) treat them. This doesn‚Äôt mean you let your child walk all over your or make ALL the decisions, it just means you respect them enough to Listen to them and Explain why you are making your decision or overriding their decision.

I do almost all of the grocery shopping/cooking/dishes/laundry for the family.  I don't perfectly keep up on these and aim to cook 1 thing, do 1 load of dishes, and 1 load of laundry a day.  I cook in a large enough quantity that my wife can have something to eat when she gets home and takes the leftovers to work and takes care of breakfast for herself and any meals she wants outside of that.

Ideally I spend about 15-20 minutes after the kids go down on work days to clear the counters and a quick sweep but we both understand when I drop the ball on that.

Here's the magic part: on days off any bigger cleaning we want to do involves 1 parent being fully responsible for the kids while the other cleans.  Often this involves me doing more of the cleaning to give me a break from the kids.  Sometimes she really has the energy to clean instead so I'll take the kids outside or entertain them elsewhere.

90,i4lm29o,t3_u2svzi,t3_u2svzi,squishbunny,Parenting,"I agree theoretically with the need for structure, but if I'm being honest our lives have about as much structure as a water balloon, yet both of my kids are reasonably well-adjusted (the toddler is in the process of adjusting), obedient but not mindlessly so, able to take things in stride, pending an emotional outburst sometimes (most of the time, in the toddler's case, but she's 20 months old, so that's understandable).  I feel like imposing a structure might work out, in a ""fake it until you make it"" sort of way. But what a lot of people are forgetting is that discipline is not just about stamping out what you don't want, it's also about fostering what you do want. 

A lot of people are hopelessly vague about this, in the sense that they have no expectations. Or that the expectations they do have are not age-appropriate (expecting a 5-year-old not to cry when they fall). I think, in your case, you need to sit down with your wife and figure out a) what are your expectations, b) what you can do to encourage them to meet them.  It may simply be a matter of giving more hugs.  It may be a matter of reframing the issue (cleaning? bleh. Race to an empty floor? Game on!). It may be a matter of adding structure (no snacks after 3 pm). But whatever you do, you do it with the expectations that your children are going to fall in line.  And of course there will be setbacks. Of course there will be fights. And this is why having a vision, as it were, is so important: so that you can see the wrong behavior, figure out what's driving it, and help them get to where you want it to be.  

The other thing I would encourage you to do is take a look at your 5-year-old and notice all of the times he's being a good kid. Make sure he knows he's a good kid, even if he sometimes messes up.  Because if you tell a kid, ""You're such a terrible child"" often enough, guess what: you're going to have a terrible child. Because you, their parent, basically told them to be.  

My last piece of advice is to read up a bit on behavioral modification. Positive reinforcement is not a cure-all, but when balanced with a healthy dose of natural consequences and age-appropriate expectations, it is by far the best way to raise well-adjusted kiddos.",1649875431

But- I will say that my kids get along well in general. They also spend very little time in their room. It's basically just for sleeping and storing their stuff.

We have 3/4 children with ADHD diagnoses though, and it's clear to us where this comes from. My husband has learned coping strategies. He can do short-term things, but it's much harder for him to do long-term planning.

But he will jump in and do all the things once I've done the planning/legwork and worked out a plan. So, we're a good team in that respect.

It seems like your husband has other mental health issues with the hoarding aspect that he needs to deal with long term.

 For now, however, you need to be really up front with him about this situation. You are not a SAHP whose job is the house at this point!! You are at home because of disability due to a high risk pregnancy!!! YOU. ARE. ON DISABILITY. This is not about how to split the workload between a SAHP/WOHP. It's about one spouse not supporting the other through illness (the ""in sickness and in health"" part of the vows). When someone is ill, the other spouse needs to step up.

 If he can't/won't take care of you/the house during your time of disability, then he needs to hire you cleaning and caretaking help. Ask him:

Occasionally I get tired of the same old and try something new, and I am more lenient on whether they eat it or not. I still make them at least try whatever it is.

I don't think eliminating snacks is a great approach. Kids generally eat more often in smaller amounts. That is actually suppose to be a healthier way to eat in general. The problem isn't the snacking, it's what they eat while snacking. Those tend to be easy things - gold fish, cheese sticks, chips etc. Keep healthier options available for snacking - celery or carrot sticks (smear some peanut butter on top), tangerines, bananas, sliced up cucumbers, unsalted nuts like cashews, grapes, snap peas. 

You also need to try to remove some of the stress. I'm super hypocritical here (my daughter eats her breakfast SOOO slow. If she has a blackberry, she eats each individual tiny ball of it after dragging her feet to get to the breakfast table, ) - but you're setting up a dynamic where eating is stressful - so they won't want to do it.

67,i4ljk0b,t3_u2virc,t3_u2virc,nox-lumos04,Parenting,"I highly suggest following Kids Eat in Color on IG (they have a website too if you're not on IG) She is so calm, non-judging, and even without purchasing any of her picky eating programs, she has helped me immensely around mealtimes with my kids. 

A few things that I took away from her that you may find helpful.

1. Always offer one comfort food that you know they'll eat in an ""unlimited"" (enough to fill their tummies) amount. We do things like milk, toast, plain pasta etc. 
2. offer teeny tiny portions of new foods
3. give absolutely no pressure to get them to eat. They eat the new food? Fine, don't praise it. They refuse to eat anything other than the comfort food? Find, don't say a word about it. 
4. Make sure he is sitting a mealtimes, with no screens. If this is hard for him, set a timer and build up to your desired time. 

By no longer pressuring them to eat, mealtimes became A LOT less stressful for me. At one point my older son was on a medication that supressed his appetite and he was losing weight, so we introduced a bedtime snack to help get some more calories in. This is basically always full of foods I know they'll eat. A peanut butter sandwich, whole fat yogurt, cereal, sometimes even ice cream, so that I can be confident that they aren't going to bed hungry. For a while it seemed like my oldest was holding out for snack before bed and not eating his dinner, but this evened out after a couple of weeks. He now will eat potatoes prepared in several ways (before wouldn't even look at them) salmon, broccoli, spinach salad and he is now very willing to at least taste something new before rejecting it. 

It can be so hard when your child is refusing to eat, especially when you notice they start to lose weight. It's downright terrifying, and I know I felt so inept as a mother - eating is a basic need, and we weren't meeting it. I haven't purchased any of her programs or meal plans and this account has been amazing for me. I imagine that her picky eaters programs would have an even greater outcome. 

Good luck. No matter what, it will be ok! And you're doing great!",1649874479

69,i4ljiku,t3_u2rsja,t3_u2rsja,frenchieflower,Parenting,"I think you already know what you need to do here. A few things that might be helpful:

1. Right now, today, make a safety plan. Stash enough clothes for you and your son for a few days as well as any important documents in a safe place. Do you know where his birth certificate is, your SS card, birth certificate, drivers license. Put them all in one place or make copies if you think that would attract too much attention. Change your passwords and sign out of iCould or anywhere your messages could be stored and read by someone else.
2. The Domestic Violence Hotline is built for this. If you call them, they can tell you where you can go and be safe and help you figure out logistics like what you'll do for money and food while you are figuring this out. If you can't call them, do what I did and take your son to the library. They have a chat feature on the computer and you can have a secure conversation without anybody knowing who you're talking to. 

Priority # 1 is to get you and your son SOMEPLACE ELSE. This doesn't need to mean you are leaving your husband forever, it just gives you the time and space to think and potentially find some resources like counseling to help your family.

I will tell you that I did not have a safe dad, and I spent my childhood wishing my mom would do something to help me get out of there. It's impacted everything in my life and ability to relate to others. You have done an INCREDIBLE job recognizing these red flags and you are AMAZING for asking for help. You will be okay - better than okay! - and so will your son.

In 2014, I was where you are. I packed a bag and took off and I had no idea what to do next. Today, I am married to someone else have have a beautiful daughter with another baby on the way with my new husband. I couldn't have imagined that before. It can be done, and you can do it.",1649874464

I do the laundry, errands, and most everything kid related with the exception of sports. If my husband can make it to a game or practice - he wants to do it. 
While I do the dishes he always does something with the kids like playing a game or watching a show. 

All this said - if I don‚Äôt feel like cooking, we order. No one gets mad.  If I get behind and want to have a cleaning service come in - I do it, no one gets mad. If my husband doesn‚Äôt feel like doing the trimming and pays the neighbor kid to do it, no one gets mad.

I'm also 16w pregnant and we have 2 elementary aged boys (my stepsons, DH's from his first marriage, they live with us full time). My job is flexible in that so long as I get my work done well and on time, it doesn't really matter when I do it or how long it takes me to complete. I'm also in a toddler friendly field (I'm the early intervention coordinator for our area) so if she's on a Zoom meeting with me or in the background of a phone call, no one cares. I would say I do 75% of the housework but it's mainly because I'm picky about how certain things are done (like making sure meals are balanced while my husband could/would survive on ramen noodles). 

I cook almost all the main meals - suppers during the week, breakfast, lunch, supper on weekends unless we eat out. The boys are responsible for preparing their own breakfasts during the week (cereal, breakfast bar, yogurt, etc.) and packing their lunches the night before if they don't want what the school will be serving. The boys do their own laundry (I put the detergent in and start the washer after checking the cycle) but I do all other laundry (we also cloth diaper). Daughter helps to put her stuff away. The boys have chores they are able to do if they want spending money (sweeping or vacuuming various rooms, taking out the trash, feeding the animals, doing dishes, etc.). Everyone is responsible for cleaning up their own messes, including daughter with help, because I'm not the maid. Husband and I take turns closing up the chicken coop at night and getting daughter in pajamas. He does 100% of the mowing and other outdoor work except the garden and hatching eggs/taking care of chicks (those are my projects). 

I would say that as the kids get older, it gets easier. We put the expectation on them to be active and responsible members of the household. I grew up in a completely opposite family environment (the wife &amp; daughters were responsible for 100% of housework) and my brother was basically incapable of doing anything when he went to college. My husband was legally emancipated at 16 so he learned quick how to do things. I would feel ashamed if our boys went off to live on their own and couldn't do their own laundry, sweep the floor, make themselves meals, etc. or if they expected a girlfriend or wife to do it all for them. 

There have been times where DH and I have had to have a hard conversation about the division of labor, but it usually comes down to our differing expectations and communication. Mainly this is because we have different priorities and different standards that we expect, so if we want something in particular then it needs to get communicated. Neither of us are mind readers. We also respect and support each other as people, professionals, and parents, and know that what the other does is *hard -* our days are completely different but both are difficult in their own way.",1649873838

32,i4lhocu,t3_u2virc,t3_u2virc,hystericant,Parenting,"My son is both a choosy eater with a relatively narrow list of foods he's open to, AND now is on medication that limits his appetite.  So we have experienced weight loss that is enough to be a red flag to the doctor.

For my kid, the doctor says Carnation breakfast shakes - and let him have 2 a day.  They have chocolate, vanilla and, I think, strawberry.  For the chocolate, there's a lower sugar, high protein and 'regular' version.  The pediatrician said just do whichever one my kid likes.

Someone else said this but I will echo it - be as nonchalant as you can about what he eats.  Choosy eating can come from being selective about tastes and textures and can also come from a power struggle.  When you are nonchalant, you at least eliminate the power struggle aspect.

I am generally NOT a fan of rewarding for eating, but one thing that did work WONDERS for us was a ""new food chart.""  Basically every time he ate 3 or more bites of a new food, we'd print out a picture of it from Google Image, cut it out, and paste it on a piece of posterboard that said ""Billy's New Foods"".  When he filled up the posterboard, he got to trade it in for a new toy.  Individual foods could go on there more than once - because repetition helps them get on the regular menu.  I didn't have 'slots' I put each picture into because I re-sized them according to how much I weighted them in challenge/value.  So he tried beets, and the beet picture was really big.  After trying green beans a couple times, he still could put it on the board but the picture might get a little smaller.  I tried two ways - one was printing the pictures myself ahead of time and having them there on table.  The other way was after he ate the food, going upstairs, doing the GIS together, and then letting him cut out and paste on the picture.  The latter approach was more successful - it built positive attention into the process too.  The other advantage of the chart is that it is a visual reminder to the kid that he has eaten this food before.  Butternut squash was another that went on there a few times, so if he was shaky about it I could ask him to go check the chart and see if he has eaten it before.  When he saw he had, he became more open.  But the way my kid is, HE had to verify that with his own eyes - me telling him wasn't enough.  Even if you go this route, still be nonchalant - don't beg and plead for him to eat.  Don't encourage ""But don't you want to get a picture on the chart?""  That works against you.  Your entire vibe can be just that this option is available to him and you don't personally care either way.",1649873762

So now it just sounds like a chore scheduling problem, if he is unwilling to budge still, and not find a way to do those chores set out, or is just unwilling to communicate and negotiate, then this may be a bigger problem in a relationship? Might be time to get a counselor, sometimes a third party can help.  


But marriage counselors can be expensive. So if he isn't willing to compromise, what are you willing to do in the meantime? Do that stuff without complaint.. everything else, leave it be, let it stay messier longer.

Our kids also have their own chores (teens) because if you live in this house, it is also your responsibility to help keep it tidy.

here's how we have divided it:

* me:  cooking 4x/week, laundry, floors, master bath, basement bathroom
* husband:  cooking 3x/week, his own laundry (his preference), grocery shopping, vacuuming, dog tasks (bath etc), outside stuff, garbage.
* kids: their room, powder room, folding and putting away everyone's laundry, their own shared bathroom, walk the dog in the evening, setting/clearing the table and sweep/clean table after each meal.

And when the kid is older will he switch and give them a bigger bedroom? Or is he okay with sending the message that his non-work office is more important than their personal space?

In any case you need to press him on his actual reasoning for needing the bigger space for non-work related stuff. The location is one thing, for his focus, but if he can't justify needing the extra space then he loses and the baby should get a room they can grow into as their personal space, which I'm betting requires more space than whatever the heck he's doing in the office.",1649873352

As hard as it is, you absolutely have to relax.  Children this age have very little control over their worlds, as a 4 year old you are told when to go to bed, when to bath, what to wear but you are starting to have some body awareness so they learn pretty quick that they can control what they eat.  Try just not fretting about it. So what if he eats nothing but goldfish and cheese for two days? Eventually he will get bored of it and eat something else.  Offer him choices for his food or a selection of foods with one of the items being something you know he will eat or do all of the above.  Eventually the power struggle will pass but there is no need to make it tramatizing for everyone in the meantime.   


And I do get that it is stressful.  One of my daughter went through an extremely picky phase around that age and would only eat a few bites of the foods she deemed worthy enough to eat (no joke I think there were maybe 8 foods she would eat - they were all crap) .  We just kept offering her food.  For example -- yes we are having chicken for dinner, here is chicken, rice and mac and cheese (knowing she would only eat the mac and cheese) but we just kept doing that and not pressuring her to eat the other foods, just some encouragement here and there.

So often, the best way to teach her is to let her learn from experience and be proven wrong.

We're in a shop. I've already bought sweets for the tub at home and we had been to a cafe for a treat. In the queue she asks for a pack of Ferrero Rocher. I explain no, because they have nuts in but also I've already bought treats. She has about 7p in coppers in her pocket and tells me she can buy them herself. I explain repeatedly she can't buy them and she doesn't have enough money. She INSISTS she does. My communication is very clear, everyone in the queue should get a very clear picture that this is a teaching moment. I tell her she is welcome to try, but she will be told she doesn't have enough money. Of course she doesn't believe me.

So when it's our turn in line, I say to the shop keeper with knowing looks that she doesn't believe she doesn't have enough money and needs it hear it from  her.

But, raising kids is a lot more time intensive and interferes with work life more than other hobbies/interests. So, people who don't have kids can still progress fairly reasonably in a career even if it isn't their main goal/interest.

The star reality is that women are penalized much harsher professionally and financially for having children than men, and this is true regardless of which path you take, it might just be to different degrees depending on how much time off you take.

I did love being a SAHM. And I did some freelance/part time/volunteer work to keep skills/relevancy.

You can‚Äôt win as a working mom. You‚Äôre right.


Because you *cant* be a great parent, and certainly not an engaged and full time parent, AND a great worker, at the top of your game and slamming down promotions left and right, at the same time.


It‚Äôs not possible, and it‚Äôs fine- because *Nobody is supposed to do that.*

U/spare_article is right, and makes an excellent assessment of the situation. I‚Äôve been a childcare worker (nanny, early education teacher, special needs aide ) for more than a decade. When both parents work full time, they are never fantastic parents for their kids. 


Luckily, what they do instead is outsource childcare to people they believe would be better at it. If they are correct, it just barely works. If they have the Mary Poppins of au pairs and the Hogwarts of daycares.


But it‚Äôs really tough, practically and emotionally, for parents AND hired care workers to triple parent a child  in shifts. Boundaries are messy, parenting strategies are unintentionally (and sometimes intentionally!) undermined on both sides.


If you‚Äôre trying to be a freaking full time lawyer, you can‚Äôt put the full time mental energy it requires into paying attention to your child‚Äôs idiosyncrasies enough to make parenting as smooth and emotionally fulfilling for both parties as it is when said lawyer-parent is a STAHP instead.  You‚Äôve got a caseload a mile long and shit to do, for god sakes! And so you sacrifice some kid for the job.


And the reverse is true. You‚Äôre not making that promotion when you‚Äôve tossed aside 2 days of research to teach your child to play piano, or work on potty training, or hold and cradle him when he‚Äôs really ill. When you‚Äôre running late and have ketchup hair, it‚Äôs not unlikely you‚Äôll get passed over in the pre-meeting meeting for someone who looks sharper and got there earlier.  But *you* are shaping your child and trusting your instincts, and creating memories and bonds that you otherwise wouldn‚Äôt. And so you sacrifice some job for the kid.


This is now going to sound super douchey And contradictory feel like, but I do NOT mean it that way: the only way I could work out to be exactly the parent I wanted was to do what I do- childcare. I take my kid to work, and I never miss a moment or a paycheck! But guess what? Childcare makes jackshit pay, and has no ‚Äúprestige‚Äù, in the eyes of others, I‚Äôll tell you that! So like everything in life, its a trade.


I‚Äôm preparing to be a STAHM soon, because3 kids and a job is a hilarious proposition, and I want to parent my kids all day every day because I‚Äôm a better fit for that than I think I could find with the money I have.


My partner ADORES our kids. But she is a better (fast paced corporate job) person than she is a parent. It‚Äôs about skill sets. So she works her ass off over there, and I will work my ass off over here, and we divide and conquer.

My kids eat a ton though you wouldn't look at them and expect it.  I try to make sure that every carb is packed with either protein or fat to keep them full longer. They burn a lot of calories.   They can use chalk in the garage and driveway to their heart desire so long. We have tablets that they can draw with as well.   Food and drink is limited to the kitchen and outside.  Dogs help clean up after them and narc on them. I've had a combination deadbolt on the pantry and a combination bike lock on the fridge for a few years now to limit what they can snack on as they started making themselves 3am PB&amp;J at 3YO and leaving a mess plus climbing shelves to teach what they wanted like rampaging monkeys.   There's also fresh fruit on the counter (we go through a ton) and applesauce that they can easily get into.  If they don't want that,  then they're not really hungry and may be thirsty.   Keeping a regular routine helps a lot and they have to be in their beds at bedtime. Bedrooms are for sleeping but do have books.   Toys are in the unfinished basement.   If they are too exhausted, they may not play as well at soccer or get as many points in Class Dojo from their teachers so they are getting that cause and effect.  I am not great about giving points in Class Dojo at home but still give negative points after a few warnings which affects how they can change their monster.  I also jam the devices (TV is internet cable versus cable so I can block that in a heartbeat) and kindle. The kindle have time limits and you can require so much education stuff be done first.

57,i4ld3dx,t3_u2kxcu,t3_u2kxcu,Honeybee3674,Parenting,"I think most often these comments are in response to particular situations. When a young adult is living at home but behaving very badly, acting entitled, not taking any of a parent's offered help (therapy/school/work), reddit tends to remind them that they're not beholden to continue supporting that child. It's a tough-love thing, and trying to avoid enabling no progress. Usually advised as a later resort after other things have been tried. 

Or, I see it directed to teenagers living in toxic homes, where people are advising them to try and find ways to save/hide money, find scholarships, etc. so they can go LC/NC once they're legal adults. And some toxic parents are ready to kick their kids out the door as soon as they turn 18. Others might just be really struggling with difficult teen years and say it to relieve steam.

I don't think most people generally expect 18 year olds to be fully financially independent/out of the house. My 4 kids will qualify for free community college, so that's the plan for them (whether they look into some kind of trade school through CC or transfer to a 4 year school), to stay home and get those credits and save money/lower school debt in the long run. Plus, I just like my kids as people. I don't expect to run their lives, though. But our kids seem to have a lot more autonomy for decision making about their own lives than a lot of their peers.

He hates mashed potatoes. We eat a lot of potatoes, so that‚Äôs an issue we haven‚Äôt found a solution to. I think the most important thing is to keep offering his disliked foods along with the food he‚Äôs actually going to eat. Don‚Äôt make a big deal out of it, just put it on his plate. Try to vary the way you prepare a certain food. Apparently learning to eat a food goes like this: tolerate it on the plate; touching; tasting; eating. So just keep offering and in the end they‚Äôll probably start eating it (can take a lot of time though!). 

When I get frustrated by my toddlers behavior around food I try to imagine myself in his place. Those new foods flavors and textures are genuinely unknown to him. It would be like someone putting a not very palatable and definitely unknown food on my plate, like cooked liver, or seaweed, or raw pork (change examples according to your own palate obviously).

20,i4laimj,t3_u2mmvy,t3_u2mmvy,PennyPanda1,Parenting,"To be brutally honest, the first 12 months of a baby‚Äôs life (in most cases) they are solely dependent on the mother. Obviously you are able to offer your newborn cuddles or help with bottle feeding if that‚Äôs an option as well as nappy changes etc., but honestly the best thing you can do is support your partner to the best of your ability. Becoming a mum for the first time can be a big challenge mentally and it‚Äôs so important to feel supported by your partner through all of your breakdowns and moments of self doubt new mums experience. Put your partner as your main focus and be her rock. This will build a solid foundation for your new parenthood journey together. 
Working crazy hours and starting school soon is going to help set up your little family‚Äôs future, there is nothing selfish in that. It probably sounds like a drag and you feel guilty for it, but if you put in the hard yards now and while your son is still a baby, it really is the best time to do it while he‚Äôs still so young. Children don‚Äôt start remembering things that happen in their life until at least 4-5 years old btw. 
And if it‚Äôs any consolation, my husband has only recently really started to bond with our son who is now 2yo. Purely because he‚Äôs been 100% dependent on me since birth, and up until recently has refused anybody else but me. For almost 2 years my husband has felt like he has nothing to offer his own son, but we both know it will get better as our son gets older and can communicate properly, in fact he will likely be drawn to my husband more and more as he realises I‚Äôm not into all that boy stuff.

Secondly, I was sexually abused by my father beginning at about 3yo and it didn't end till I was about 15/16. He did it to me my siblings, my cousins and my friends. He acted this way with me and others, especially the butt touching and the over sexualization of literally everything we did. He also abused my mom and gave her pretty intense ptsd and Stockholm syndrome. If you have internal red flags, please protect your son. He deserves that. 


Lastly I just want to say, divorce and custody can be tricky. When my parents divorced my dad got split custody with my mom because none of us were brave enough to say anything including my mom. That means part of the week we were completely alone with him. Just compile some evidence of his behavior to bring to the judge to try and get either full custody or at the very least monitored custody.",1649870629

Based on just those few sentences, you seemed to be implying that kids should be quiet and allow adults to hug them whether they want to be hugged/held or not, and parents who don't make them do that are ""doing nothing"" and are causing their children to ""be nightmares to everyone around them."" That kind of attitude is what gives predators an opening and normalizes children not being allowed to speak up for themselves when they are molested.

After your clarification, maybe that wasn't what you meant. Following up on your further comments, nothing in the posts says that OP or the commenter haven't done all these encouraging socialization things. Some kids are just born with different temperaments and are going to be more insistent on their space. 

I'm guessing you have one child. Congratulations, your child is friendly. Of course it must be because of your perfect parenting. We all think our kids are the way they are because of us when we have our first. After you've been in the game for awhile, you realize there are a lot of other factors at play.

Thyroid being off can affect your other hormones too.  May want to see a female hormone specialist like an gyn that specializes in menopause.  You may not even be absorbing the vitamins either. 
One of my friends had a doctor that was convinced she was bipolar and was pushing to prescribe those kinds of meds but wouldn't do a full thyroid panel.

Personally, I would not have wanted to take two little ones on a long flight, even though I took 4 kids everywhere for day trips as a SAHP, but I was not interested in doing overnights without my partner, lol. 

We did split a couple trips, but it was a couple times when I took a nursing baby with me somewhere, and left the older kids home with their Dad. Usually just 1 night, maybe two. But that was more about the baby needing me than anything else.",1649867458

We did punishments and grounding and took away toys and access to things and ultimately he still could not control himself.

Eventually I had to remove YouTube from all the smart TVs set up passcode so he couldn't reinstall it. 

Couple times I caught him installing YouTube on the Xbox and watching it then which he swiftly got in trouble for.

All of this while he still had access to YouTube kids which we told him was a better alternative for him because the videos are safer then just unfiltered YouTube.

So again if your daughter isn't really doing self-destructive behaviors well to get access to Roblox or breaking the rules I actually wouldn't even define this as an addiction.",1649867422

48,i4kzde8,t1_i4kvxam,t3_u2daqh,Tngal123,Parenting,"I have hashimotos.  TSH is a crappy indicator.  Would definitely get free T3 and free T4 labs as well as reverse T3 done with next TSH as TSH may not correlate and when it does, it's only with free T4 levels.  Free T4 is the storage hormone which your body has to convert to use. 
In the early stages of hashimotos, it attacks and kills tissue and you become more and more hypo. Definitely keep searching for a better doc in your area as thyroid affects your entire body and may even improve the endometriosis.   The one that finally diagnosed me with hashimotos told me I was euhyroid as I had no symptoms (BS) because my TSH was fine despite my frees being in the toilet. He'd only do meds and then only T4 med if my TSH got higher or I got over 300lbs.  In the 90s, TSH has to be over 10 for meds and mine was consistently 9 then.   I'm betting getting your thyroid handled and maybe even on a suppression (all thyroid needs met by meds so you're not damaging more thyroid tissue with the hashimotos) protocol will help you feel a lot better.  

You have hashimotos if you have the antibodies.  A lot of endos are clueless in treating and then only treat based on TSH with synthryoid when you become hypothyroid enough.   It's just like an OB may be wonderful with singletons and non placenta sharing multiples but not understand the higher risk and monitoring of monochorionic gestation so there's an avoidable negative outcome.",1649866826

I did this with mine, And even at 8 years old they still eat those and that way I can feel okay that that's how they get their vegetables. 

Other than that I encourage to keep letting them try new things, And if they seem to have a general interest in something or you're pretty sure they would like it you kind of just have to force it on them. 

There's been times that I had to make a grilled cheese sandwich the only thing my son was allowed to eat for a day. Like I made it he took the smallest nibble ever, said he didn't like it. So I told him that was the only food he was getting today until it's finished.

Fast forward it he loves grilled cheese sandwiches, not the most healthy thing, but still a good to have some level of variety.

How to do something similar with turkey sandwiches.

Now as a child I would only ever eat mac and cheese, And well into my teenage hood I would generally not eat any vegetables, certain textures would literally make me puke. But now I was an adult after personally forcing myself to try and retry vegetables and fish and other things I eat a pretty wide variety of things so there's hope",1649866797

78,i4kymwh,t3_u2rsja,t3_u2rsja,Honeybee3674,Parenting,"I agree with everyone else. You are not over reacting. There are serious problems here.

If your husband is sexually molesting/abusing your son, and it comes out later, and it's proven that you had even an inkling that something wasn't right, YOU could have your son taken away from you by the authorities for staying with  him and not protecting your child, even if you were not involved in the abuse, and even if you were groomed/abused by your spouse yourself. You have to leave to protect both of you.

Now, leaving isn't simple. You need a safety plan. If he scared you with his controlling behaviors when you were pregnant, he is likely to escalate once you try to leave with your child. Enlist the help of friends or family (ONLY people you trust not to gaslight you, take your husband's side or tattle on you to him... if there's anyone who was in your life that you have been distanced from because of your relationship, that might be a safe person to reach out to). Look for resources for domestic shelters online (will he read your browser history? Maybe take your child to library story time and use the computers there to look for resources. Also look up free or low cost family law help and advice for your area.

It also just might mean she's more of an introvert and prefers to play with closer friends in a more controlled environment which is what games offer.

Even as a 22 year old senior in college, freshman seemed like kids. A 30+ year old getting an 18/19 year old pregnant is seriously uncomfortable to start. You were still a kid, he was a fully grown adult. It's hard to explain the amount of life you live and experience you gain from age 18 to age 32.

Add in your gut feeling that something is off about the way he views his son, plus him treating you badly while you were pregnant and not having a good marriage, and you have major red flags. 

Kids aren't sexual. Our adult brains are supposed to remind us of that. His brain is drawing connections from child behavior to sexual behavior, and worse yet, he's verbalizing them as if it's normal and acceptable. It's not.

(well i already know you didnt/arent going to take his name, this is just my general feelings) its just a name really, it can hold whatever weight you give it. if your name is important to you, and its important to you that your daughter has it, i think youre 100% in your right. the effort your husband had in creating her, his physical contribution, was less than an hour of the entire process, YOU are carrying her for 9 months, YOU are pushing her out of your body (or having an incredibly invasive surgery to birth her), YOU have been the one mostly planning and preparing for her arrival. why give him all the 'credit' with his last name?

i think fathers are important yes. fathers can and should be able to put in an equal effort into preparing for, raising, and providing for their child, like picking up more housework, fixing up the nursery, buying things for the baby and their pregnant wife, overall just picking up a lot of the burden the mother shouldnt have while she is exhausting so much of her resources into creating an entire little human inside of them. the fathers will never be the ones carrying the baby, they are not sacrificing their body in the same way the mothers are. if the mother wishes to give the baby the fathers name, that is her decision and is valid. but it sounds like your husband is not doing this.

In the hopefully very short meantime during this ‚Äúpreparation period‚Äù, never once let your child out of your sight, he should never be alone with your husband for any reason. If safety becomes an immediate concern, contact the proper authorities. The order in which you initiate these steps may vary in priority on a moment to moment basis, but regardless, the most vital thing for you and your child to do is get as far away from your husband as humanly possible. It is crucial to understand that your son is in danger. This is a situation where, in a ‚Äúperfect world‚Äù, you left yesterday.",1649866170

8,i4kxnit,t3_u2sx4w,t3_u2sx4w,DragonReborn64,Parenting,"It sounds like your wife needs to establish more authority over your daughter. She has learned to push the boundaries when you're not around.

Firstly because she's six, All three of you need to sit down and have a talk about this behavior, Make sure to let your daughter also come up with ways to help correct this behavior. I have found people and including kids are more keen to listen to their own advice...

Secondly, your wife needs to realize that your daughter is just upset and to not take it personally when she says mean things. It sounds like your daughter does not know how to appropriately convey her feelings in a way that is not hurtful. It will be up to your wife in the situation to correct the behavior so that instead of saying hurtful things your daughter says how she is feeling instead. At the same time it's important that your wife explains how the stuff your daughter is saying is hurtful.

My kids went through like a two-week phase each of saying they hate me or my girlfriend, And this is how we corrected their behavior. My son who is ODD \ autistic responded well to this tactic.

Finally it's really important that your wife can hold a boundary with your daughter. If my kid was giving me attitude about getting dressed to go to the park, I wouldn't take them.

It took one or two canceled trips to realize that I mean business when I say we don't need to go. They pretty much obey at this point especially when there's a fun trip on the line.

A lot of the dishes we cook at home rely on marinating (or use a pre-made sauce) so the idea that we could set aside an unsalted portion for her wasn‚Äôt gonna work. On the off-chance that we could salt at the end, we‚Äôd want to cook her portion softer (dad likes his veggies crunchy and mom likes her meats rare), so we‚Äôd have to set aside an unsalted portion for her, finish seasoning ours, then put her stuff back in the pot to cook longer.

Looking back, I think if I hadn‚Äôt been so hung up on the salt thing, BLW might have been more amenable to us. Then again, self-feeding infants are messy as hell, too. Our daughter would vomit at the slightest gag, so most meals ended with an upset baby and a massive clean-up.

34,i4kwqs2,t3_u2odkz,t3_u2odkz,Catzy94,Parenting,"Mine is 1 and 4 months and solidly in the stranger danger phase. Try to think about it from their perspective, as many have suggested. You‚Äôre a tiny, defenseless human that just realized people you don‚Äôt know keep invading the personal space you just discovered you have. That‚Äôs scary and frustrating.

On top of that, as the parent you have to consider that a lot of parenting trends are later proven to be very wrong. Sometimes it‚Äôs the new stuff that is lacking scope and sometimes it‚Äôs the old stuff we never knew was damaging. This phase is one of those where the advice just changed in the last 20 years.

I‚Äôm an older millennial, so I got to see firsthand how a lot of parenting trends were actually terrible in hindsight. The problems they were addressing absolutely existed and something needed to be done, but the scope of the problem wasn‚Äôt fully understood yet so the advice didn‚Äôt help.

Perfect example of this is arguing in front of your kids. In the 90‚Äôs, parents were told it was a huge no-no. Like, it would emotionally damage your kid and hold them back developmentally because it would destroy their stability. That‚Äôs partially true. We then discovered that we learn conflict resolution from how our parents modeled it for us. In the 90‚Äôs we could see clearly that the abusive arguments our grandparents considered normal were damaging. However, giving us no model at all was almost worse because then any time we had an issue in our relationships, we had no idea where to even start on resolving it. The solution was to only have healthy arguments in front of your kids. If you model arguments that become emotionally abusive to your partner, your kid is learning that‚Äôs how couples treat each other.

This is one of the those. Previous generations saw kids as an extension of their parents. They weren‚Äôt seen as independent people with thoughts and emotions that matter. So, it was fine to barrel over their consent and hug them even if they screamed. They needed to learn that people aren‚Äôt always scary. That is true. It also true that kids need their consent respected.

So, now you‚Äôre at a crossroads. We know the previous way of doing it was damaging. We have this new idea for how to do it, but that could be exactly the right answer or another one that goes too far in the other direction. In my parenting, I like to meet in the middle based on where my partners and I have hang ups with the advice.

I don‚Äôt want my kid scared of people. But, being a SA survivor, I‚Äôm going full mama bear the second you make my kid uncomfortable. So, we don‚Äôt push our kid to interact with anyone. He can walk. So, I tell everyone to say hi without getting into his personal space and then let him come up to them. 9/10, he will. The exception is when people get too close too fast.

The other puzzle piece is your kiddo has a natural personality. Parts of their personality and how they interact with their world are genetic, some are chance, some are experiences. An extroverted kid is going to be more open to people while an introvert is going to be more closed off.

So, I know I‚Äôve pointed out a lot of possibilities, but my actual suggestion is to gently explore all the options. I would start with new people keep a small distance and let your kiddo adjust. From there see where the comfort zone lies. If your kiddo has a chance to feel safe, do they interact on their own? Do they need a little push? Test the waters. Stop at the first sign of distress and re-evaluate.

And remember, there is no right answer for every child. There are options we know to be 100% damaging (abuse, neglect, etc.), but out of all the healthy options it‚Äôs going to be what works best for you. You got this!",1649865814

I think when it comes to the lesbian role play, it's really just going to depend on how deep they go into this role play. Kind of like how kids will do the hey let's play mommy and daddy type of roleplay, at least that's what I hope they're doing.  For this segment I'd recommend actually watching her do some role play in Roblox with her ""friends"" to see exactly how explicit they're going....
Basically a child can explore sexuality without it being sexual, which is weird I know to say. I know of a few adults that did plenty of lesbian Barbie roleplay when they were kids. Except they didn't know the word was lesbian it was just 2 mommies for example.

Second part of this is evaluate her statement of friends... Are these real life friends that she could go visit in person at this point or in the near future, or just friends she made online? Again depending on what they're doing in Roblox it might not be that big of an issue.

I would also be careful labeling it as an addiction, especially if this is her only source of socializing beyond school.

68,i4kw3bh,t3_u2qs0d,t3_u2qs0d,Honeybee3674,Parenting,"Feeding our babies shouldn't have to be a big chore or ordeal. Most people in the world/history grow up eating their culture's food just fine without introducing food in a special order or making special meals. Other than making sure food is safe (choking hazards, food allergies in the family, etc.), the truth is that, within reason, how you introduce solids to your kid is really not going to make any long term difference. 

Seriously, I listened to the advice about only introducing whole, organic foods, avoiding processed foods, encouraging but not forcing different foods, introducing one thing at a time to check for allergies, etc. I banked on the guarantee that all this effort would pay off and my kids would have good palates and enjoy healthy foods.

Guess what? The books lied. My kid that has the good palate, likes to cook, will try new things? He's the one who grabbed a sandwich out of his older sibling's hands and stuffed it in his mouth at 5 months of age. He has ALWAYS been an experimental eater. My kid who absolutely refused all solids until age 14 months? He had food sensitivities, sensory issues with the texture of food (he will eat some healthy foods now as a teenager, but will not eat mixed foods like stews or casseroles), and also had a speech delay, so obviously some oral motor issues that likely affected his early eating  habits (but he learned to eat just fine and was perfectly healthy without forced feeding or feeding therapy). My oldest, who as a 1-2 year old ate dried peas, whole grain bread, and a bunch of other healthy stuff (OMG, I thought I was the BEST mom ever)... yeah, well, he gradually started crossing foods he would eat OFF his list, no matter what we tried, and he is now a processed-food junkie who hates to cook or prepare a meal at the age of 18 (all my other kids will cook for themselves. He would rather spend his own money and pay double for Uber Eats). My youngest, who got the least amount of time in the whole-foods, healthy eating program, is somewhere in the middle. 

I spent about 15 years and much, much energy stressing over good food and developing healthy eating habits (while still allowing other food in moderation, at parties, at others homes, etc. Junk food wasn't forbidden fruit), and at this point in time it feels utterly pointless.",1649865564

When it comes to age gaps, I realize there can be exceptions to the rule, but in most cases as a person closer to your husband's age I tend to look at guys who would consider dating essentially a high school student as...well, I think there's a reason for that, and generally that reason is people in your husband's age group, his peers, they have enough experience to see the red flags in maturity or whatever we want to call it. I honestly saw the same from a guy I know, dude kept striking out with women his own age, or at least within reason of his age, and when that became a thing, dude started dating a high school senior. His bros, myself included, we were like WTF dude, what could you possibly have in common with this person? 

And I think that's something you'll see as you get older, and...you know, that's probably what you're starting to notice right now. I think the exception to the rule I'm talking about. Listen, as a person near forty the whole ""age ain't nothing but a number"" thing only flies so far, you know? I absolutely believe life experience can be an exception to the rule, and I think that IS what's happening to you. You're a wife now, you're a mother, you're growing as a person and...lady, now you're seeing why a man nearing middle age sought you out.

As a one-off, I wouldn‚Äôt worry about the song.

85,i4kt5b4,t3_u2rsja,t3_u2rsja,CommentToBeDeleted,Parenting,"A few thoughts.

The touching: If you think it could be more serious, you need to protect your child. Period. Whether that means setting up a hidden camera or full on leaving, that is up to. They are at an age where they are learning things that are and are not okay. Their safety needs to be your top priority, full stop. If you think it's not more serious and just uncomfortable, you need to have a conversation with him and be direct. This is your child too and if he values you and your opinion, he wouldn't want to continue touching them in a way that makes you uncomfortable.

The comments: These seem juvenile and disgusting, especially given the context. Again, your child will be learning things that are and are not okay. They will want to emulate their dad. If you don't want them learning to do this, you need to call this out every single time. Tell him it's not funny and you don't want him saying that around your child. You need to be prepared with how to deal with it if he doesn't take you seriously. Do you take your child out of the room for a period of time and ask him to pick up the slack elsewhere? Do you consider counseling? Unfortunately it doesn't sound like there is a lot of respect in this relationship, so I'm less optimistic with how he'll respond.

The crying: This is where we differ. Anecdote, so take it with a grain of salt. For my first child I had the exact same approach you had. If she was sad and felt like crying, she was allowed to cry, whenever, wherever. We never made her feel bad for it and told her it was great she could express herself. At 4, she cries over absolutely everything. It's the first thing she tries when she is unhappy in any way and when that doesn't work, she tries crying some more. It's not her fault at all. As a parent I did a MASSIVE disservice to her with how I handled crying. Crying is absolutely okay. It's okay to cry when you are happy, or sad, or even when you don't know why. You shouldn't be ashamed of crying. BUT, like everything there are times when crying isn't acceptable or appropriate. We have since tried transitioning to an approach where she can cry, she just can't do it ""here"". She needs to go somewhere else and cry. She's not on timeout and can come back whenever she is done. She can ask me or her mom to come be with her when she cries (if its makes sense), but she isn't allowed to just break down and cry when she doesn't get her way and not expect to have consequences.

Having said that, I don't think telling a child that crying means they are a baby is okay or good, I just want to emphasize that the other extreme end of the situation isn't ideal either.",1649864433

They lived way from family in another state when we were young, due to a recession and finding jobs, so they didn't have family babysitters available.

I don't know how my grandparents were when my parents were young, but they had active social and community lives as long as I remember. They did live in/near their hometowns with a lot of family and long time neighboors/friends, so I think they had more social/community supports when raising young children than my parents did.

But we had grandparents on both sides available to help with some babysitting, and I had a pretty good social network of friends with little ones, too. 

So, I think what kind of support parents have makes the biggest difference. But also, parenting standards were a lot different. People weren't expected to be perfect parents, just adequate ones. And the standards of a ""good"" parent were a lot lower. My generation is called the overlooked, latchkey generation for a reason, lol.",1649864074

Refocusing on support for OP, I agree this is a symptom of a deeper issue in your relationship, which I can relate to. But it‚Äôs up to you how you decide to address it with your partner.

And as for name, I recommend using your surname as your child‚Äôs middle name. It avoids putting your child at the center of your resentment and also gives you - and the child - the flexibility to drop his name if relationship evolves over time.

They have snacks( fresh fruit, cheese, guacamole, chips, waiting everyday) and I cut them in cute  shapes. We talk about their day. Yesterday we had a nerf gun battle inside the house ( much to my husbands annoyance). They played on their laptops then I made them sushi for dinner and we has homemade cake. Bedtime showers brush teeth required by 8 pm. Then we jumped on my bed to play uno for two rounds. Bedtime is 830 but the little one wanted extra cuddles and talk about his new stuffy names snakey so he stayed in til 9 pm. If they have homework they are allowed two hour cool down after school and have to get homework done and I sit with them ( they ask) if they don‚Äôt want me to sit next to them I‚Äôm in the same room.

I‚Äôm humans. I apologize if I‚Äôm wrong. If my kids say mom you were wrong or mean I apologize. Explain why I may have acted that way and why it was wrong. I respect my kids. My kids are spoiled!

Life probably feels so fucking heavy for her and she absolutely does need to know how much you love her and want her to be ok but right now and for probably years to come she won't be fully ok. Let her know that the healing process takes a long time but there is hope and happiness at the end of the journey of healing. Young teens often feel like how they are feeling is forever and just remind her this pain isn't forever or at least that with time it will hurt alot less.  it sounds like your in pain from all this to so maybe find ways for yourself to get help and therapy. Educate her and yourself on substance abuse disorder because if she turns to drugs later down the road to cope it will only get worse. And never stop hugging her and telling her she is very very loved even if others have failed her so badly already this far in life if she knows you never will that may be all she needs to keep going and fight for a healthy mind and life.

My third born is nerotypical. My fourth born has not been officially diagnosed, but I'm fairly certain he has imulsive/hyperactive presentation of ADHD (but doesn't seem to have actual problems with attention, lol).

Learning about how ADHD brains function can really help you with parenting strategies. Our kids went to a Montessori school, where they had more freedom of choice and autonomy in how they did their work, so they weren't sitting still at a desk all day, and were mostly doing hands-on things with manipulatives at a young age instead of worksheets. So, we didn't have much in the way of behavior or other issues at school in elementary (except for the one who needed extra supports for reading/language which wasn't primarily due to ADHD).

We did not use meds for any of the kids until around 7th/8th grade. At that point in time, school demands  became more rigorous, and social and emotional health were impacted by more difficulties in emotional/impulse regulation, so the meds helped my kids to better apply the mental brakes, and gives them a better opportunity to learn those coping strategies and techniques. 

Most of the research shows the best results with a combination of meds and behavior techniques/therapies/etc. And things need to be re-evaluated as they get older, in terms of what kind of supports/accommodations are needed or kinds/dosages of meds help best. 

People with untreated ADHD (and using appropriate therapies/supports counts as treatment, too) are more likely to use substances to self-medicated, get in more car and other types of accidents, and more likely to experience depression/anxiety issues. So, it's an ongoing assessment of ""is this treatment protocol working right now? Could it be better?""",1649863018

Gifted kids often do not need to study in the earlier years and will pass elementary schools with no grades less than a 95. However, their grades will start to lower in the later school years due to the fact that they never needed to study before. Do not take this as a sign that they are not trying or ""aren't applying themselves"". It just means that they are leveling out and need some positive encouragement to boost them back up. 

Remind them that they do not need to be perfect too. One of the worst things I gained from growing up gifted was this crippling need to be perfect at everything the first try because that's how it was when I was younger. I never needed to put in any effort, so I didn't put in any effort in my later years.

Some things that helped with us:
- having them help cook. We got toddler knives and a helper stool so they‚Äôre usually up on the counter with me while I‚Äôm cooking, and they chop veggies. When dinner is ready I make a big show of ‚Äúwow this looks so good, I can‚Äôt wait to try what you made!! Everyone, (child) helped make this and it looks so yummy!‚Äù 
- we implemented a timer when my oldest was a little younger than 2 because he would say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want this‚Äù or ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like this‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm done.‚Äù We would say that is totally fine! But dinner time is still family time, so you have to sit with the family. We set a timer for a few minutes and told him he could get up when the timer went off OR when he ate some food. Most of the time he would get bored waiting and would just eat his food because (surprise surprise) it wasn‚Äôt that he didn‚Äôt like it, he would just rather be doing something else. The few times he chose not to eat, that was fine with us - we didn‚Äôt want to push it, but we did let him know this was the only dinner option. We rarely ever have to use the timer now, my youngest caught on quick and we never really had to use it with her. Won‚Äôt work for everyone, but it was great for us! 

For snacks, there‚Äôs a kids cookbook called ‚Äúpretend soup‚Äù with lots of meals that kids can easily make/help with, with pictures.

16,i4klc6i,t3_u2fmnb,t3_u2fmnb,Honeybee3674,Parenting,"My kids went to a Montessori school where young kids were taught to put their hand on an adult's arm to signal they want their attention, and then quietly wait for the adult  to finish. The adult can put their hand over the other child's hand to signal they know the child is waiting, but finish up their original conversation/thought, and then give the child their full attention.

It was brilliant. They start this with preK kids, who are very impatient, and it works wonders. They continue it into later grades (although I think it naturally fades out in older grades as kids are able to wait without the signal). Your child is a little older, but since she's still having this problem with you, I think it would be a great way to help you both.

You can also tell her that you want to be able to hear what she has to say, and give her your full attention when it's her turn, so this method is a win-win for both of you. Explain the new method, practice it together in private, and then the next time she interrupts you, you can quietly take her hand, place it on your arm, and maybe touch your fingers to your lips in the quiet sign to remind her of the new procedure. The first couple times, reinforce her patience by switching to her fairly soon, then spread out how long she needs to wait (she's 9, so it shouldn't take too long to get to the point of having a longer wait so you can actually finish your conversation).",1649861371

Maybe the prep can be harder, and the clean up is a little more messy, but the baby having the independence to feed themselves is so amazing. I can enjoy my food while they enjoy theirs.

I think BLW is what you make of it. You can find intricate recipes online but there are so many easy things that take hardly any time to make or prep. My baby's favorites when we started were cucumbers, any type of berry, steamed vegetables, lots of eggs, toast with peanut butter or applesauce, whole fat yogurt, shredded cheese, pasta. My baby also loves any kind of meat. 

Here are a few more ""complicated"" meal ideas but really aren't too hard. 

Berry French toast: smash your Berry of choice, I normally do blueberry or raspberries. Mix with an egg and cinnamon and use that as your batter for the French toast.

Veggie chicken nuggets: use a cheese grater and shred carrots and zucchini or veggie of choice. Mix it with ground chicken and seasonings like onion powder, garlic powder. (But be sure to omit salt, as your baby doesn't need extra salt at this age.) Use an egg and breadcrumbs as needed and form them into patties and cook on griddle or pan. You can also use ground beef and do meatballs. 

You can also look online for BLW pancake recipes. All of these recipes I double or triple and freeze for easy meals later. And for dinner the baby eats what we eat most of the time, just cut appropriately for him. BLW doesn't have to be hard!",1649861199

79,i4kjqtj,t3_u2iu9q,t3_u2iu9q,Honeybee3674,Parenting,"I agree with others about the window/door alarms to keep her safe.

It sounds like you have an independent and maybe strong willed kid. I have a couple like this, and punishing and doubling down on freedoms only makes it much worse and encourages more sneakiness.  Removing Girl Scouts makes absolutely no sense. How does removing Girl Scouts--which helps teach  responsibility, helping people, safety, etc. -- help teach your daughter not to sneak out at night?? Punishment makes kids feel like you're trying to control them, and they rebel. 

Instead, I would encourage you to have calm discussions about safety with her. You can emphasize that it probably felt really good to feel free and independent, and like a big kid by going to McDs in the middle of the night. You can discuss other ways she can get the feeling of independence and freedom in a safe way, maybe discuss ways you would be comfortable with her playing with the older kids during the day, etc.

 I would also add that NOBODY in the house leaves in the middle of the night (or any other time) without telling anyone where they are. This is a safety rule everyone follows, even the adults. Mom doesn't leave without telling Dad, and vice versa. It's not just a rule for kids, but for everyone. Kids don't like feeling ""lesser,"" and sometimes the rules are different based on age, but it often helps to point out the ways adults also check in with one another, and take care of their own safety, so kids can see that safety rules aren't only for them. 

I have learned to stress safety and my concern instead of punishment. I do allow them to feel my genuine fear and upset in the moment, but afterwards there needs to be a calm debrief, explanations and problem solving. 

With our kids, particularly my youngest who pushed for the most independence early and often, we started giving him freedom with boundaries. Like, riding his bike along the sidewalk to the corner and back, playing in the yard. At some point, he was allowed to ride around the block (so no crossing any streets), later he was allowed to cross the street and bike around an empty church parking lot (not on Sundays) where we could still see him. He just had to let us know when he left and check in when he came back around. I don't remember exact ages, and he generally started doing things with an older sibling, and then was allowed by himself. But the point is we GIVE him freedom and autonomy with boundaries before he feels the need to try to take it. If he breaks a boundary, the freedom is removed as a logical consequence (not a punishment). If he can't be trusted to wear his bike helmet, then his bike is off limits for a time. If he goes out of his boundaries or leaves/crosses a street without asking, his roaming territory would be reduced, or he might end up grounded to the house. 

We spent a lot of time with our kids outside and in our neighborhood, teaching them on what to look for as potential dangers. They got to run ahead during walks, but then stop at street corners and wait for us. Then I asked them to look and tell me if it was safe to cross. I taught them to NOT follow a ball into a street, and made sure they would stop  every time and look both ways before retrieving it (we had a steep driveway), and when they could I trusted them to play alone in our yard. They knew scooters/bikes had to be on the level sidewalk, and not going down our steep drive.  We taught them to look out for vehicles backing out of driveways, and to always stop before the driveway if a car motor was running. Our super independent kid became really good at sticking to his boundaries when we show we trust him and show confidence that he's capable (because we teach him to be capable and what to do ""in case"" of various situations.)",1649860748

Travel actually isn't horrible. Job applications varied from system to system as to whether my hyphen was a valid character. My son is learning his name at school and they dropped my half of the name while teaching so I had to correct them.

Is your full last name long and/or common names? Mine is 4-8 and some forms have cut off a few letters. I had the 4 name originally and it was so easy but often misspelled and not well known so now people hear it as a similar first name and on the phone I've ended up with my name being 4 as the first and 8 as the last. It's truly a weekly thing for me. So many sort things by last name alphabetically, like voting, there they look for the wrong letter to start with. My husband doesn't get it because I'm kinda the household manager while he does 60% of the hands on chores/childcare. 

I'm hoping my son just drops one half of the names when he's an adult so he doesn't need to deal with my uncommon name mixed with the hyphenation. With my 4 letter last name I would say ""NAME, A B C D"" and spell it out, which is easy when it's short and sweet.

Regardless of whether your kid goes to that class or not, you need to step up and have frequent conversations with your kid. Get some books (there are some that are more graphic novel/comic strip like if your kid isn't a big reader). Leave them in your kid's room even if they say they don't want it. 

It is going to be hard to start talking to your kid about this stuff this late, because now they're in the getting embarrassed about it stage. It's so much easier to lay an age-appropriate foundation when they're younger and curious.

I suspect it's the ‚Äúhate it when he does it"" part that's a key problem.  Kids are really smart, be and if he gets extra care and attention when he bangs his head, or if he sees it's having an emotional effect on you, that's a strong reinforcement for him to do the behavior.

One thing to make sure you avoid is to reverse your ‚ÄúNo"" because of the tantrum.  That's made worse if you only sometimes give in (Google intermittent reinforcement), and even worse if you only give in when it gets extreme.  

At the end of the day, he's trying to communicate and deal with his frustration, so the key is to give him other ways to effectively communicate it.  That means you'll need to validate his frustration before it gets to three point where he doesn't feel like you understand (even though you likely already do understand).  

Our middle child used to flop on the ground and bang his head for a while. These books really helped:

* [Raising Freakishly Well-Behaved Kids: 20 Principles for Becoming the Parent your Child Needs](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/0979628776)
* [Boundaries with Kids] (https://www.amazon.ca/Boundaries-Kids-Healthy-Choices-Children/dp/0310243157)
* [The Happiness Trap](https://www.amazon.ca/Happiness-Trap-Struggling-Start-Living/dp/1590305841)

The key is being able to remain calm, cool and collected yourself when it's going on. It's your job to teach him how to [handle his own emotions](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JD4O7ama3o8), which he learns by watching how you manage yours. That means teaching him that his frustration is very important and shows how much he wanted to do/get something you said no to, but he still is expected to keep himself safe and not take hurtful actions toward himself or others when he's feeling that way.  

A three year old may not yet be ready to learn that lesson, but if you can learn how to stay consistently calm, even if you have to restrain him and protecting him from hitting his head, he'll learn quickly that it's no longer a strategy that's effective as a way to make you uncomfortable and express his frustration. He'll learn that your do see his frustration, that you're not going to give in if he tantrums, and that you'll care fort him when take care of him either way.  

Good luck.  It can feel impossibly hard to keep your cool until you get used to it, but after a whole it becomes second nature, and he'll learn to keep his cool too.",1649858861

1. The police probably won‚Äôt do anything
2. The parent and child could be separated, leading to the child being place in an unfamiliar and possibly worse situation
3. You don‚Äôt know the full story- the child in the scenario is seemingly a teenager. She also sounds aware of the abuse. Take into account the kids feeling in the matter. 
4. By calling the cops you can make the situation worse for the victim later. 

The best thing to do is try to deescalate the situation (does not have to be in a confrontational manner) eg. walking around browsing the shelves, casually talking to the parent about how high gas prices are, etc.",1649858800

We started at 5.5 months with Roast Lamb, Baked Carrots and Roasted Potatoes, and have not stopped our food explorations for over 2 years.  She's 26 months old now and can sit in a ramen shop with me and eat a bowl (or most of one) with no spilling and uses her chopsticks passably well.  

&gt;but I also feel like it‚Äôs a lot of work to do BLW!

It was SO MUCH WORK.  Hours and hours of throwing food, tantrums, fits etc.  I feel it was deeply worth my time as she is the least picky eater I have ever known, and also now helps with washing dishes, sweeping and general kicthen upkeep.  Around 15 montsh old I started have her manually pickup anythign she threw on the ground, and had her place it in the trash can.  

Then she waited until next scheduled meal time for more food.  

I loved the BLW process and results, personally.

35,i4kekbl,t3_u2esg1,t3_u2esg1,cokakatta,Parenting,"Oh no! I'm so sorry you're going through this. My husband is so similar it's ridiculous. 

If I was in that situation I would look at a couple of other solutions.  First of all when the baby is small the room size probably doesn't matter a lot. Dresser, recliner chair and crib will be fine for the baby days if you can fit that much in.  So don't worry right away. The closet is good for baby gear storage but if there are other closets in your husband's office, couldn't you just put overflow (off season things or future size clothing) in your husbands office? Even the crib and dresser might fit in your bedroom in the infant days and maybe your husband will find that .... motivating.  

Next, if the kids have a play room (do they?), do they really need to have large bedrooms?  My son has a large room but it doubles as his play room. We also put a desk in there this year as he's getting older. But if you have an office downstairs you can set it up for the kids to have their kid desks and books and games. 

I'm not saying your husband is right or fair but sometimes family life isn't right or fair. You don't have to pick this battle now. Focus on the necessities. I think things will work out or you will find a perfect chance to make your point. 

My husband is so similar but I'd rather he have all his stuff in one room than take over all the closets and leave stuff around the rest of the house. Actually my husband still does use a lot of our closets like the guest room closet, etc. It's something we are still working on. But I think if you tey to find ways to make the best of him having his own room then you can find a lot of optimal solutions. Don't worry too much about the baby being jealous of bigger sibling for now. That can be re evaluated when it happens and the kids can make the case to their dad.",1649858645

IIRC from my son's short little league career, coach pitch is 1st and 2nd grade - but it could be different in my area, not 100%.  I think being on an ""undefeated"" team is supremely UNimportant for 6-7 year olds, but, I think good coaching is important.  To me, good coaching (for that age) doesn't just mean ""gets a win,"" but it also means instills good sportsmanship, builds skills, gets all the kids on the team playtime not just the exceptional kids.  It means NOT pursuing a ""win at any cost because we value the win"" mentality, but a true cultivation of the sport in kids.  That approach absolutely can and does build fantastic teams that can work together well and get wins.  

I would not move away from a great coach for family, but I would not prioritize ""wins"" as my reason to stick with a team either.  Not in the age group I think we are talking about anyway, but if I am wrong there that could change things.  I guess I would think about what it is I want my kid to get from the sport and what values I am communicating.",1649858493

It was rare that she would abuse me while outside but it was always a possibility (she was very explosive and even a tiny thing would set her off). I remember just wanting someone to help me, to walk up to her and tell her what she was doing was wrong. I always recognized the abuse and often tried to speak up, but in the end I felt powerless. I think the best this you can do is say something to the parent and to the child, to console them. However you should assess the situation first so you don‚Äôt make it worse. I really disagree with all the people who say call the cops, because it can often end up with the child and parent being split, and the child ending up in foster care, or the abuse getting worse. This isn‚Äôt always the better option and you need to take into account the child‚Äôs feelings on the matter. (I called the cops on my parent when I was 7 and learned abt what would happen if they were to find that I was abused. That scared me more than the abuse). Also the girl you are referring to sounds like she knows it‚Äôs wrong and isn‚Äôt afraid to speak up, have some faith in her. Not all of us are scared little children with no voice. I developed a voice and spoke up, and when I was able to I got the hell away from my mother. This girl might find a way to do the same.

The other 2 got to have independence from me starting from a young age. I work at a gym and starting at 6 weeks old put them in child care for 1.5 hours a day and I worked 2 nights a week so starting young they had dad as primary caretaker for those 2 afternoons into evenings. Be however, she was only 2 months old when we went into lockdown so she didn't get any other f that until she was 1.5 (when my place of work opened again). It was a battle to get her ok with not being with me. She still can get really clingy, but it's getting better. Here's what helped us. 1. NO MORE SLEEPING in OUR BED. The minute she comes in I walk her back to her bed. I always notice she's super extra clingy after sleeping in our bed, even just an hour or two. 2. Getting her into my gyms childcare, having other adults watch her, and working nights/forcing her to have dad as primary care taker for HOURS at a time. 3. Setting boundaries around my body. Saying things like ""it's your sister's turn to have a hug, you need to wait. You have to share mommy."" Or "" mommy is making dinner, I can't hold you, you can bring a chair over and help, but I can't hold you."" Or "" you are a big girl, I know you can climb this. You don't need my help.

This is not a neglected child and if the child ever questions why they have the smallest room, there is a simple explanation - bc all of the other rooms were taken by the time the kid was born. 

Quite frankly, it is outrageous that she has a problem with the guy wanting to keep that particular room as his office. She should be trying to make the guy‚Äôs work environment as productive as possible for him, but she seems like a control freak. For some reason, she seems to want to dictate where he does his work and she is completely dismissive of his need to work in a certain environment. So what if he doesn‚Äôt want to work in the downstairs office? Some people are particularly sensitive to outside stimuli and where they do their work is a big deal. I‚Äôm assuming that the job for which he needs to do work at home at least partially pays for that five bedroom home they all inhabit, so if he needs a certain type of work environment, let him have it. Stop being so bossy. 

And even if the guy gives up his office, that won‚Äôt solve the problem. Why? Bc the kid will still have a smaller bedroom than the sibling and will want to know why. The problem cannot be avoided so give the kid the smallest room and let the guy keep his office. Perhaps when the older child goes to college, the younger child can take her room or something. The kid will be fine until then. 

One last point, if you notice, she refers to the 4 year old as ‚Äúmy‚Äù child and the new child as ‚Äúour‚Äù child.

Baby/children's bodies are super resilient. Not everyone gets a ""best case"" outcome, but don't give up hope. As an aside, something like 90% of children with cancer experience full remission. Imagine how much less devastating cancer diagnosis would be to adults if we had those odds. Just an example of how different their little growing bodies can be",1649853098

Let me just say that I am a feminist in the definition of men and women being equal. And if they are at a job, there should be equal pay. I‚Äôd honestly prefer the phrase humanist instead, but I digress. 

But I feel like something happened along the way that in the quest for equal rights, women are now expected to somehow do *everything*. It is my opinion that it‚Äôs  impossible for a woman to *fully succeed* at raising kids **while also** and *fully* succeeding at a demanding career. There just isn‚Äôt enough time in the day. And I also find that in a lot of my friends‚Äô dynamics, she‚Äôs still coming home from work and doing a majority of the house duties. 

I think this also partially stemmed from some men back in the day just walking away from their families, and the women freaking out as to what to do. My great grandfather left my grandmother in the 30s. My grandfather was 6. His sister was 4. My great G‚Äôma spoke broken English and had no career to fall back on. It was an awful time for them. 

I also understand the desire to succeed in the workplace and I understand that mothers have every right to do what they want - if they want to succeed in a career, they should. But there just isn‚Äôt enough time in the day. It‚Äôs just a math equation, something will have to ‚Äòsuffer‚Äô.

First, daycare is extremely hard to get in my city. We were on the waitlist for 10 places (the max we can do through our city's waitlist services) for 2+ years and never got a spot. Second, there is no full day preschool as far as I know, just morning or afternoons. You can sign them up for both I suppose, which is what I did with my son. He's in the Mon-Wed class and the Tues-Thurs class, but they only run mornings.

Last, my son has autism, and he attends a lot of appointments so we need the afternoons for that. Also because I like being able to take him on walks and spend one-on-one time with him! I learn a lot in his therapy appointments and need time to apply it, and I can do more one-on-one than the teachers can. It also gives us time in the afternoons for other activities with kids, like playgrounds, indoor gyms, extracurricular activities, or just having fun at the park with the mini zoo they have on display. And the great thing about preschool is they close for 2 months in the summer, which means we get a ton of time outside and going to the beach and stuff, I'm very excited for that because he loves the beach. :)

Yes, historically mankind has committed atrocities against each other.

I don‚Äôt think any of those people back in the day could do what they did and truly think they were doing good things. I‚Äôm sure they justified why they felt they ‚Äòhad to‚Äô, but I can‚Äôt see any of them thinking they were good. Maybe they felt they were *right*, and that the ends justified the means, but I cannot accept they thought they were good. That‚Äôs precisely why instilling morals is so important.

94,i4jtrei,t3_u276ko,t3_u276ko,dogs94,Parenting,"My basic advice....  As someone a little older than you with my kiddo in college is to calm down.  :)

This is a huge time in your life and what you're talking about is a decision that could impact the rest of your life and your child's life.  You're talking about a decision that would almost certainly end your relationship with the father (who doesn't sound like a wonderful guy, tbh) and possibly impact your kid's relationship with his/her father's entire family.  

I'm just saying this isn't something to talk about lightly.  And I get that reddit is her so we can talk about things we don't talk about in RL.

For starters, it might not even be possible in your area.  In some states, if you know who the father is, the state basically names the child for you.  So go google that stuff for your state: What happens when the mother and father can't agree on the name of their child?

The other thing is you and the father need to get into relationship therapy asap.  I'm divorced and remarried.  I do not believe that marriage is a sacred bond: It ain't nothing but a series of day-to-day agreements to walk the same path TODAY.  I also don't believe that mothers and fathers need to be together to raise a wonderful young adult.  

But.... divorcing with kids is not for the faint of heart.  Guys are typically less mature than girls.  We all know that.  It's not a bad idea for you two to sit with a therapist and for him to stare into the abyss of what his life COULD look like if he doesn't shape up and make a decision about his future.  

And wouldn't it be the best outcome for all of you if he could just get his act together?  I mean, you still get to be mad at him for being a shit the last few months, but it's still best if he makes a very rapid pivot to what you want him to be.  

Sometimes boys are only scared straight when they basically see death coming for them, lol.  And he obviously likes girls (i.e. you're pregnant).  This isn't a situation where he can just break up with you and find someone new.  Does he realize how toxic he will appear that the pregnant mother of his child threw him out?  I mean, he can call you the b-word all he wants, but everyone knows that pregnant women might be a bit emotional/scared.....but they also typically want the father to stick around and help.  So for you to throw him out on his ear speaks to his character.  He might want to rethink and recommit.",1649847946

&gt; maybe this is moot point and expressive language development is measured as the number of communicated concepts rather than pronounced words.

Yep.

If my kid enjoys repeatedly producing something that sounds like ""tattoo"" while babbling, but has no idea what that form of body art is, I wouldn't bother counting it for something like a school or medical form. It's not meaningful.

So if your child is using hua1 meaningfully, and then happens upon hua3 but isn't using it really meaningfully yet, I'd also say that hardly counts.

&gt; I‚Äôm curious if the number of words a child should have by X age is impacted by the inherent variability of sound in the language. Does anyone have any experience with this?

The short answer is yes. My experience with this is as a psycholinguist (MA) and trilingual parent of trilingual kids.

The question of ""what is a word?"" and ""how should we count unique words?"" impacts the studies we design and the statistics we run in a lot of ways.

Some languages like Turkish or Finnish tend to create meaning by [adding lots of prefixes and suffixes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agglutinative_language) onto a main word, or including sound changes like swapping [a] for [e], or both.

Imagine if the three-word English phrase ""to the moon"" was a single word in one of these other languages, something ""themoonto.""

In an English-speaking environment, you might say your child has the ability to understand/use three separate words. On a medical form about an agglutinative language that says ""themoonto,"" you might tick a box that shows that your kid knows the main word ""moon,"" with a separate checklist indicating whether your kid uses the ""the-"" prefix or ""-to"" ending properly. 

To an extent, we do this in English too. I've seen pediatricians' forms (like the ASQ) where they ask a bit about vocabulary size, but more about whether your child is properly doing things like combining words into phrases, using plural -s, or getting past tenses right (like/liked regulars as well as go/went irregulars, or saying things like ""goed"").

Compare the [18-month ASQ](https://www.lakepediatrics.org/docs/ASQ%2017-18%20months.pdf) to the [24-month ASQ](https://portsmouth.tricare.mil/Portals/130/24%20month%20asq.pdf), for instance. On both forms, overall vocab size will isn't the primary measure language of development. It's just one of several.",1649844838

His stepfather adopted him, but his last name was never changed. He had no ongoing contact with his bio dad‚Äôs family after he died, so he‚Äôs never felt a strong connection with his last name. My last name is very uncommon, hard to pin to any culture or race, and would have died off had we not given it to our son.

A few other adjustments that we made because of the last name. My husband had full control over middle names and chose two that honor his family. We also agreed that if our son wants to have his dad‚Äôs last name when he‚Äôs older, we‚Äôll let him choose to change it or not when he‚Äôs 12, so his first name had to flow well with his dad‚Äôs last name.

My husband and I are both aligned on the last name so no conflict there. My family loves it and my dad was particularly touched that the family name will continue. My MIL and a few other members or my husband‚Äôs family reeeally didn‚Äôt like it and some felt like my husband was dishonoring his bio dad, but he decided that it‚Äôs his kid, this is what he wants and told them to kick rocks.

We used to just keep practising really. Try gradually extending the periods of time you are away. Make sure she's got plenty of snack and drink. Plenty of games and toys to play with Daddy - new ones if need be. Get the play dough out or a water table, something novel.

My son was confidently walking at 10 months old, he‚Äôs 17 months old and babbles a lot but only says a few phrases clearly (mama, baba, meow meow, bye bye, hey google). He started getting teeth in at 8-9 months old. He‚Äôs incredibly smart, while he may not speak he understand things perfectly and he‚Äôs very independent, doing things himself like buckling his seatbelt, closing and opening doors, feeding birds birdseed, putting teabags in the teapot, using a towel to mop up a spill, etc. 

My friends son who is just two months older than my own started walking at a year old. He had 6 teeth at 6 months old and was chomping on hot dogs and burgers and chicken nuggets.

I am neither married or a parent, but child of a mother who kept both last names, Maiden-Married.

My parents were married several years before I was born, and naming me was never the issue, but schools, OMG. My first primary school, had me down as FirstName Maiden-Married. My mother had to go in there, with all my documents, to assure them the name she had already submitted for me on ALL other paperwork, was correct, and please change it? She was livid. (My only defence was they had never met my dad, as he worked with a long commute, and only made it to one(?) meeting so far.) Still, they changed the paperwork without permission. They later went on during orentation of a younger sibling to call them a name starting with A, when thier name actually starts with E. Not sure where they dreamed that one up?

The second primary school almost did the same thing, being a religous school. They were also told.

Obv probably not feasible for you to up and move to Mexico BUT if you can at all make your husband speak to you in Spanish at home it will help - eg asking you what you want for dinner. Pointing at things and saying what they are called etc. great idea to find a Spanish speaking mum friend in your area to go for coffee dates too. And watching Spanish TV. Try and avoid the English subtitles (put Spanish on so you can read it), just pick something where the plot is fairly easy to follow from context.

You could also try labelling things round the house with sticky notes to learn vocab.

I would suggest taking a course if you can on grammar even if it seems more than you need - it will just give you a good basis to build your vocab and confidence around and if you learned French at school, Spanish grammar will def make sense to you.",1649834319

OP could use the 'other office' for a nursery or a room for herself perhaps? Rooms are rooms and their uses can be interchangeable, but OP has decided what these rooms will be labelled as and can't see that in doing so, she's also causing friction. Crowbaring her partner to do something he doesn't want to do isn't how to handle the situation and will be met with a negative response.

What is actually laid out is that there are 3 rooms as options, not 2. One of the rooms has a bookshelf and was thus dubbed an office (room 1), when they moved in the husband utilized a different room for his office (room 2) and there is also a third, smaller room (room 3). OP has chosen to only see rooms 2 and 3 as options for the new bedroom (and not the 'other office'). The issue is very easily compromisable, but OP wants husband to move out of his office and instead use one of the two rooms he already didn't want. Thats the actual issue, OP if you've made it this far, it sounds like he just doesn't like being forced into doing something he's already told you he doesn't want to do. Probably try speaking to him coming from a kinder angle and assess all options and allow his input, compromising can work wonders. Maybe the playroom could be the office, the daughter's room the playroom and the two smaller rooms the kids bedrooms - you have a lot of options to choose from, work together and you might have a better outcome for everyone. Good luck!

36,i4j6p2j,t3_u1yzno,t3_u1yzno,aprizzle_mac,Parenting,"TL/DR: Kids learn and do at their own pace. If you have concerns, talk to their doc, not other parents. 


My oldest didn't walk until she was almost 18 months, my second walked around 12 months, and my toddler (who is 10 years younger than his older brother) started RUNNING when he was about 13 months. That last one kinda skipped the walking stage ü§£ The walking will come whenever they're ready for it. 

As far as talking, my oldest said her first words (""What's that?"") when she was 9 months old. It sounded like, ""wazzat?"" She has always articulated well and used words that were far beyond most kids her age. My second said his first words at 12 months (""Mama"" for the win!), but wasn't really using language to convey wants and needs until he was about 15 months. My toddler is almost 4, and he has been behind for awhile. He's a chatterbox to be sure, but I'd say he's at about 40% of his speech being understood by unfamiliar listeners. I know this because he has been in speech therapy since he turned 2. Things I've learned through this journey is that most kids can say around 100 words and should be starting to use 2-word combos by the age of 2. That being said, a ""word"" is a sound they use consistently for the same thing. For example, my toddler would say, ""Oosee"" for a dog. It's because our dog's name is Lucy, and to him, all dogs were Lucy. So Oosee became a word. Once he learned 'dog' that also became a word, so it counted as 2 words. He would say ""dunka"" for drink, and he'd sign drink, and then he learned how to say drink. That's 3 words, plus the 2 for dog, so that's 5 words and we're only naming 2 things. The reason I'm listing all of these things is because I thought my toddler was MUCH further behind than he is, because I didn't think he was saying WORDS. But going through speech therapy has taught me that because I could understand what he wanted or was talking about, he was saying WORDS. He was using the same sounds to mean the same things, and that's where his words are different than baby babble. Just keep an eye and an ear out, and try to pick up on the words he does use. You can write them down if you want, so you can keep track of them for when you talk with their pediatrician around their 2 year check up. If your ped recommends an evaluation with a speech therapist, then you'll have an accurate account of how many words and what they are. 

But the biggest thing I want to stress here is that you should only do this to keep as a record for yourself, and not to compare to any other children. 

My three children were all raised by me, in the same circumstances, with the same resources, just at different times. And all three of them are vastly different. My oldest couldn't ride a bike until she was about 10, the middle one about 8. My toddler is already riding a bike without training wheels. My oldest can read a 200+ page novel in a day, my middle hates reading, and my toddler uses books as blocks to build cities to have his T-Rex destroy like Godzilla. My oldest hates math and can't use tech to save her life, but my middle kid is a math whiz (he's doing grade 10 stuff in 7th grade) and knows more about tech than his father and I combined, and my toddler can count items (up to 20) and shows my parents how to work the tablet at their house.

Furthermore, people have a tendency to favour what they are good at, not developing the skills that they are less skilled at.

73,i4j4hw8,t3_u2cm9v,t3_u2cm9v,DuePomegranate,Parenting,"One thing that really helps is to try not to think of your daughter's behavior as disobedience. It tends to be either

1) The emotions are too much for her to regulate, which could also be a sign of over-tiredness. Over-tired kids act in all the ways that drunks could act, like getting hyper/wired, laughing uncontrollably for no good reason, angry and violent, crying over small things etc.

So when she spits at you, you think ""Woah! She really needs to get to sleep, her brain's completely fried"" rather than angry hateful thoughts that would trouble you later. You say things like ""By spitting, you're telling me that you're so tired that you can't behave properly. You're going to bed right now and you'll feel better in the morning"". Or ""You're mad and you're trying to make me mad. I'm not going to let that happen.""

2) Experience has taught her that pleading and delay tactics work. Not always, but it's worth a shot. So she's only doing the rational thing. For this you need to talk to your wife about the importance of consistency. 

By the way, consequences that aren't immediate (""lose TV time, no going to Grammy and papaws, no tablet time, no Barbie‚Äôs"") don't really work at this age yet, especially if the kid is already distraught. They are entirely caught up in the moment and can't think of what the future them might prefer. You may end up with disproportionate consequences like them agreeing to no TV for a month to trade for staying up longer now. And then tomorrow they tantrum again when they are denied TV. Some people use  ""you don't negotiate with terrorists"" to describe bargaining with a kid around this age.

You can however reward her for behaving well at bedtime. A sticker chart, or maybe just making a big deal out of giving her 6 (!!!) minutes to clean up tonight because yesterday she was so good at going to bed when it was time. Praise leads to pride and confidence that she is a good girl, and motivation to stay good.

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&amp;c.**, **&amp;c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

He'll sometimes stand for a second or too before falling towards me (in always ready to catch) but most of the time as soon a he realises I'm trying to get him to stand he stops using his legs for support so he won't stand, only sit.

He knows about 15 words/phrases which he can't say but will do the corresponding action (eg turn the page, hi/bye=wave, business=handshake) and he's worked out stacking duplo blocks.

Clearly both parents work their assess off, so why does he deserve the bigger room over his wife and child? Not to mention their other kids would probably frequent the baby room as mom will be juggling all three of them so it would accommodate the entire family better to have the nursery in the bigger room. And the rest of the family would use the room constantly as opposed to just on the weekends. And what does a bigger office really accomplish if his furniture fits in the smaller one? It's entirely impractical. And you're assuming he'll actually give up the room when the kid gets older but that's going to bea way harder battle to fight when the kid is already set up in the smaller room and he's used to the bigger one. Will he care if the bedroom size inequality creates friction in his kids relationships or will he continue to be selfish?

But it takes AGES to self develops those tools. If kids are taught how to, more efficiently, live life with ADHD medication might not be needed

I caution people about things like this.  This is absolutely true for a lot of people!   
HOWEVER...

Yes, kids/teens/adults will learn to cope and get through life without medication.  My husband and I did that with depression, anxiety, and ADHD (all likely part of the same neurotransmitter package) all our lives. Turns out that all those coping mechanisms and tricks and tips and tools were extremely stressful to maintain, didn't allow us to reach what should have been our full potential because we were so focused on getting by, and detrimental in the long run because it is absolutely exhausting to live every day of your life as a fight.  

When you've spent your life fighting absolutely everything about how your brain works in order to try to do things like have a career, clean your house, be a parent -- and you might even be labelled an overachiever --  and everyone agrees you're doing everything right, but you are constantly exhausted and miserable and overcompensating?

You've got his attention, you're repeating information that's important to him ^(substitute blue cup with whatever) and he can see the object in question. 

For walking, children walk when they're ready. There was a study that tracked when children rolled/sat up/ cruised/walked. They compared kids who do so with assistance from their parents to those whose parents waited until the kids could move on their own.

Pregnancy is a difficult and anxiety-ridden time. Others need to help with the mental burden too but is your husband aware of the concept of emotional and mental burden? If not it‚Äôs time he knew. I feel there is plenty of miscommunication and misunderstanding. Good luck and don‚Äôt stress out too much. At the end of the day the surname won‚Äôt matter to much. My daughters have different surnames and it is simply part of who they are, no issues yet apart from my second daughter being assumed to have my surname too because my older one does. Doesn‚Äôt bother me. As long as they feel loved and cared for it‚Äôs all ok.",1649818935

4,i4ilcem,t1_i4i3pkv,t3_u2cm9v,Feyloh,Parenting,"You really should switch play to after bedtime routine at least as much as possible. We do baths and teeth, school backpack/lunch setup, and toy clean up right after dinner. The kids then have until 7:45/8 to watch TV, play with one toy or puzzle, or read a book. If they do all of the 'work' quickly they may get 30+min if not they may get 5 min or 0min, average is 15m. Then straight to bed. We don't have reading as a regular part of bedtime because we read so much during the day. My children rarely fight bedtime.

As others have said, don't spank. It creates more defiance. Yelling does too to a certain extent. It creates an us vs them mentality. Of course you can always out anger your child which isn't good long term.

Don't compromise on timers, especially if the child is whining and screaming. I do compromise/negotiate if asked nicely but not all of the time but again my children are fairly good with the rules. Some negotiation won't completely derail their behavior. Until there's more good than bad, don't negotiate.

Gentle parenting should not mean permissive parenting. If it's bed time, walk your child to their room and leave. Let the child cry. You can give a quick comfort hug but don't talk it to death ""you're upset that you can't play. It is still bedtime. Goodnight."" Lead her back to her room as often as you need to. The second and 3rd time just say, ""it's bedtime, goodnight."" Any subsequent times don't say anything and just take her back.

I don't use the term gentle parenting. I say respectful parenting. Being firm about rules and boundaries *is* respectful. Never upsetting my child, even to their own detriment, is not respectful. We technically have tons of rules, but we're clear and consistent and we help our children learn the rules. They have plenty of freedom within those rules though.

If your child hasn't had clear rules and there's yelling from the parents, you're going to find that things get worse initially while you establish boundaries and no longer engage in battles, but it does get better.",1649817607
5,i4ilc0e,t3_u2csno,t3_u2csno,Tngal123,Parenting,"You can do weighted feeds to see how much she has transferred nursing by weighing her on a baby scale before and after.   Sometimes it's a growth sort and other times it's using the miles as a pacifier. 
What helped with my twins was trying to do dream feeds by feeding them before they fully woke up at night and got hangry which would make nursing take longer.  I always put them down drowsy but awake.  I used Baby Daybook to track feeding,  naps and pumping sessions. I still use it to track growth.  Looking over the data helped to see better times for doing our routine.   During the day they'd get a diaper change first and then nurse.  I would leave their sleeper unzipped as that kept them a little bit more alert to nurse and if rub their cheeks with my pinkie to encourage swallowing.    The burp them and they'd do a little tummy time before going back to sleep. 
You can always work with an IBCLC for nursing help.  Fenugreek can pass through breastmilk and cause stomach distress for babies so may want to eliminate that to see if that helps. 
Glad to hear everyone is fine now. My set were born at 31.0 weeks due to uneven placenta sharing so they did several weeks in NICU as feeders and growers though both were home from the NICU before due date.

Look, yeah, it's entirely possible that someone intervening directly in public might make it worse for the child for a few hours. But it's not going to be any worse than it had been a hundred times and will be a hundred more for any number of lesser reasons. And the child needs to know that there is help out there and intervention is a possibility. This idea that intervening is bad because it makes it worse is ENABLING abuse. And it's a cop out. Most people don't like confrontation, so they don't want to intervene, even though they know they should, so they shrug and go, I'd help, but it would just make things worse later.

You wouldn't say that about setting a bone or cleaning a wound, would you? We could fix that, but we'd have to cut your leg open and there's a high risk of infection, so it's probably best to just let it heal crooked. We could clean that wound and sterilize it, but it will hurt more for a few hours, and again every time we change the dressing, so let's just let it fester. 

My first complete memory is of half a dozen people standing by afraid to intervene while my mother bashed my skull against a granite wall when I was 5. I didn't get away from her abuse for another 20 years. So when I tell you that you're not helping the victim by not intervening, I know what I'm talking about.

Don't have options for her, other than water, perhaps with some flavour, and leave it at that. She's 13. She should neither need nor be expected to seek permission or assistance in getting a drink. So don't get involved. Liquid is available. I suspect if you're not making a fuss about it, she'll drink. 

It looks like she gets attention from not drinking. And, she seems to get a fight which you can't win from it. 

From a child's point of view, especially a teenage child, that's just wins for them. 

So just relax on it. Water is there. She'll drink when she's thirsty. Eventually.

73,i4ifqnc,t3_u276ko,t3_u276ko,chrystalight,Parenting,"Our daughter has a different last name than me and my husband. We both kept our last names when we got married. We both have Irish last names that you can combine to make another Irish-sounding last name. When we got married, we toyed with the idea of us both changing our last name, but it got pushed off. 

When I got pregnant, we decided we'd change our last names to the combo last name, and then give our daughter the same combo last name. Except then COVID happened, and we had no idea what was going on with the court system. Plus, it was going to end up being really expensive (about $1k all in, although we've since found out there's another route that should be much cheaper). We didn't exactly have $1k burning a hole in our pockets, so we figured fine, we'll just skip this for us for now, but still give our daughter the combo last name. We'll get to changing ours eventually (plus, we didn't want to have to pay ANOTHER $500+ to then change our daughter's last name).

Well now our kid is almost 2 and we still haven't changed it. We casually refer to ourselves as the ""combolastname family"" but my husband and I's last names haven't been changed legally at all. Its just so far down on the priority list right now that neither of us have the time or energy to deal with it. 

Its literally a non-issue though. Outside of family, I've gotten 1 comment so far in my daughter's 22 months of life - and it was from the daycare lady saying ""oh, you combined you and your husband's last names, that's so cool!"" Our family was overwhelmingly supportive of this choice, not that we asked for their opinion. The only one who voiced a negative opinion was my husband's grandmother. Which is funny because this is my husband's MATERNAL grandmother...so its not even her last name that isn't getting ""passed on.""

I do agree with you - you have no particularly good reason to change your last name, except that doing so would make it easier in terms of giving your baby the same last name as you and your husband. That said, I'm also not sure why you deserve to get to give the baby your last name more than your husband does. 

I used to be pretty anti-hyphenated or double-barreled last names, but these days, especially after my own experience, I definitely get it and think its a perfectly reasonable idea. Many cultures do some form of this anyways. I'd either do that, or give her a combo last name if your respective last names would lend itself to that easily. 

In the event that my husband and I were to get divorced tomorrow, the situation wouldn't change. We'd still have our ""original"" last names, and our daughter would have hers. We'd still be filling out most forms with both my information and my husband's, so it would continue to be obvious that her last name is a combo of ours. It is possible that currently when people see forms with all of our info on it, that they might not presume that we are married, but I could care less about that.",1649815145

If he forgets, or doesn't fold and has no idea whats clean, its on him to do his own not-laundry-day laundry.

As far as sorting, I spend a couple hours every season sitting in my kids room going through his clothes.  We also have a ""to small"" basket he can toss things in has he finds them to not fit.

Listen to your doctor. They‚Äôre the experts. The evaluators will tell you if it‚Äôs adhd or not. My almost 6 year old was diagnosed recently. Impulsivity and emotional dysregulation are his biggest struggles when it comes to his adhd and both of these things lead to behavioral problems. And honestly, your son‚Äôs sounds a bit more extreme than what we‚Äôre dealing with. So intervention is needed. With little ones, there is always an underlying reason for extreme behavioral struggles. The professionals we work with refer to it as MEATS. M for medical (ie ADHD, autism, anxiety, etc), E for escape, A for attention seeking, T for (I always forget T), and S for sensory seeking. The key is to get to the root of the cause and professionals are best to help with that. 

FWIW, my son is very bright too. He is considered ‚Äúgifted‚Äù per evals. Our psych told me that little kids who are exceptionally bright often have behavioral struggles because their brains are very far ahead of their emotional control which causes a huge clash. And kids with ADHD are typically emotionally immature by 1-3 years compared to their peers, so the clash is even bigger. 

My son has made so much progress since we‚Äôve gotten him help. There‚Äôs no reason to keep suffering like this. For your sake but also for his sake! He doesn‚Äôt want to be acting like this. Listen to your doctor. Good luck!",1649813394

This situation is not going to make the news, and school administrators hear the ""Im going to sue"" ""I am going to the media"" threat all. the. time. It just makes parents who escalate to this level so quickly sound very crazy. When you sound crazy, there is a much bigger chance that your concerns will not be listened to. Ask questions, speak to those in charge, stay calm, address the facts, and look for a reasonable solution. It sounds like these conversations are just beginning and like a pattern of behavious is just emerging now. It takes some time to get school staff up to speed, for them to create a responsive plan, impliment that plan and see results. As much as it is upsetting when your child encounters what sounds like a very troubled young person, no school can just say, ""Oh he showed your daughter his penis? Well he's expelled then. Case closed."" That will never be the result you will get. Instead it would be helpful if you consider what an acceptable result is to you, and advocate for that. For example, that the boy have close adult supervision during unstructured times like recess.

I often describe it as he is incapable of thinking before he acts; he just acts. Therapy has been helping a lot, and his dad and mom are considering medicating (he's 9, and I've expressed my support in this already). 

I'm not saying your kid has adhd, but if your PC wants to test for it, there's a reason. I'd look further into this. Behavioral issues like this aren't particularly normal on such a frequent occasion. Every kid acts out, but consistency of this kind I'd behavior is indicative of a larger issue.

Ultimately, he decided to go with my last name because my family has been a huge support to the both of us and it would make his life easier too (he's a 4th, which complicated paperwork).

The in laws weren't happy about it, but at this point in time enough boundaries have been laid to establish that it's okay for them not to like it, but if they want to be in their granddaughters life they have to accept it.

My Autistic (aspergers) 10 year old was diagnosed with Autism last year (at 9) we did a full spectrum for Autism, Anxiety, ADHD and Depression. We suspected the autism, which was confirmed. But we also found out he was under medicated. 

He was the unicorn model child until we got to about 6-ish. It blew up normal emotional behaviors and it appeared a lot like you describe. There is a lot of emotional disregulation. I'm unsure if that is the ADHD or the aspergers, BUT if you go into the office and tell them the behaviors you're seeing they can make a plan for what to test for, to at least eliminate things. So we found out that although I was worried about Depression, he is NOT depressed. And all of his anxiousness was autism related, we also found out that he has mild OCD and his IQ was wicked high. 

So, our official diagnosis is inattentive ADHD, Autism- Aspergers type with presenting OCD and Anxiety. 

Which is SO much less scarry than him just being anxious and depressed (like me) and also gave us a heads up that his deficiencies in school were caused by his ADHD, and the anxiety from the Autism was making those worse.

You give her a warning and a timer and then give in when she cries! And then you try to reason with her. The response should be, I understand you're upset it's time for bed. It's okay to be upset! We will play some more tomorrow. Do you want to put your pajamas on or brush your teeth first? 

She's going to throw the tantrum. But you're allowed to have boundaries.  You must have boundaries!

Get a refund for the tickets.

My daughter was like this as a baby - she always always wanted to be held and be on the breast, and cried terribly when she was ever alone and not being touched. As she grew up I realized she is just a highly sensitive person and feels things very deeply, and she was likely seeking comfort in a brand new scary and overwhelming world (she is 13 now and that‚Äôs just her personality, unlike her sister who is much more chill, both today and as an infant).

I think its important you understand what the dad might go thru, but ultimately I believe quite strongly women are given an insane ask if they want kids. Dads shouldn't be muscled out of the picture, but even if you were married, names are important and nobody should force you to give your kid a name you don't like. You're giving the gift of birth.

I think people do that because their first assumption is you can't afford it. I think a firm but kind response like ""I appreciate your intention but my son may not have candy before his lunch. I would appreciate some space to help my son work through his feelings, have a nice day."" Actually informs the other person why they are not being helpful, encourages them to think before they act next time, and also helps your son hear a reaffirmation of the reason. 

Not playing devil's advocate here. I agree strangers would do well to butt out in this case, but I like to have de-escalatory phrases planned ahead of time so I don't get flustered (because then I'll snap at the stranger, which I don't think is appropriate).",1649803536

Name issue came up again when we got married. Hubby wanted me to take his last name‚Ä¶ I might have but it just seemed weird to change our kid‚Äôs last name. He‚Äôd been Kid MyLastame for almost 3 years, so Kid HubbyLastname didn‚Äôt sound right. So no name changes.",1649801658

68,i4hl1tf,t3_u1smax,t3_u1smax,GREAT_SCOTCH,Parenting,"My daughter also has a hard time with unexpected changes and hearing no.  She will be 4 soon.  As a general rule I've always tried to keep the number of ""no""s to a minimum, because no one likes hearing no.  I read somewhere when she was a toddler that in order to feel autonomous, kids should hear 5 yeses for every no, so I try to stick to that.  I do of course say no st times l, but I find the less I need to flat out say no to something, the less intense the reaction is to it and the more readily she will accept it.  

As for dealing with unexpected changes, that's part of executive functioning and is tied in with temperament.  Some kids just have a really hard time being flexible.  It's a skill they can build, but it's not easy.  Just know that this isn't because she's bad or that you and your wife are bad parents, some kids just struggle more than others in some areas.  If she was having trouble speaking you (hopefully) wouldn't blame her for not having that skill or blame yourselves for not parenting her properly, you would find a way to help her strengthen that skill, like working with a speech language pathologist.  Sometimes lagging executive functioning skills can be a result of neurodiversity, so I would get her evaluated.  Sometimes they are not but there's still supports out there to help that her doctor should be able to direct you to.

A book that really helped me understand my daughter better and work with her on the things she struggles with was Raising Your Spirited Child.  I think you might find it helpful.  Another amazing book that I'm reading now is The Explosive Child.  It helps parents recognize what skills a child may need to work on and gives a framework to break them into smaller, workable issues and goes over how to approach your child to work collaboratively to understand and solve the issues.  I've heard very good things about this approach and am going to implement it with my daughter soon.",1649801491

But it's more than that and if you can grow with your baby no matter how old you are, you will be able to better overcome the obstacles that being a parent or new parent bring. Then having a baby around and it being yours will make you so happy. My wife says that I became a new man after we found out about our pregnancy and I see she became an all new wonderful mother. And we feel so lucky because our son is so wonderful and our situation is so wonderful but it wouldn't be that way if we didn't grow and turn into the parents we need to be for him.

31,i4hi4jf,t3_u10i8v,t3_u10i8v,New_Cook6903,Parenting,"When my son was 12 months old, he got referred to early intervention. COVID with its isolation when he was 6 months old, did not help. Was not verbalizing or pointing; also did not develop the princer pinch. Did ST and OT 1x a week each. OT really helped with the hand strength and coordination, but other than a couple hand signs, not that much process with verbal communication. No screens and around 90-120 minutes a day of reading. We went to Australia for 5 months, when he was 18 months old. There was no COVID there at the time, so lots of social interactions (kids/adults/library time/ muesums, etc). Massive language explosion. Still very minimal screen time and lots of book reading. He is now 2 1/2, placed with older kids due to his language development, knows his letters and numbers. Is starting to recognize words due to the letters making up the words (pre-reading skills). 

Some thoughts üí≠ 

1) signing is still communication. I work with medically fragile children who have trachs and hooked up to oxygen. They literally cannot speak but they use signing for communication. Once they‚Äôre weaned off of ventilators/oxygen and the trach is taken out, the change in speaking using verbal language from sign language is amazing. Signing still uses the part of the brain for verbal communication. 
2) I thought screen time was looked down upon due to the crowding out effect; essentially the time the parent would interact with the child or read to a child is crowded out by screen. And I thought that this is why it was discouraged. However there are other detrimental‚Äòs to screen time, the ability of eyes focusing and attention control. Other kids mileage may vary. 
3) My sons language grew in some part because he wanted to communicate with others that did not understand his baby talk or signs. 
4) Reading is great for kids because it enables them to understand the structure of language with different words that aren‚Äôt commonly used in language. Books acted as a tool for my son to help him understand language. His first word was dog and that‚Äôs because he was being read a book about a dog and saw my mom‚Äòs dog and point at the dog and said dog. 
5) finally, you know your kid best. If the problem is expressive language, you know best what works best for your child to get them to communicate. The mommy wars are not fun, so if you think the screens would help, you can make that call.

These little, tiny moments stack up, but you have to be consistent overtime to see results. I know, toddlers won't even give you 1 minute, especially if they are clingy ones! What is a meaningful break? Tip 1- put on a song that raises your vibe (especially with a toddler, they can dance as you move your body to the music together) While you're dancing, breath in BIG and smile. Smiling deliberately is proven to trick your brain. Tip 2 - aromatherapy. Rosemary oil, lavender oil, or my any citrus oil. Keep away from the little one and only use high quality oils. Take off the cap and breathe in 5 deep breaths. Seriously, this one needs to be done consistently over time for your body to adjust, but it will help - especially if you are highly sensitive to stress.  This worked so good for me, using Wild Orange, my body now thinks it is a shot of espresso! Tip 3 - You can do this for yourself, or do it together with your child. Open your hand and and spread open your fingers. Next take your pointer finger of the other hand (or have your child do it) and breath IN as you touch and trace your open hand from the base of your thumb to the tip, breath out as you trace from the tip to the bottom of your pointer finger, breathe in as you trace to the tip of your pointer, out as you trace to the bottom of your middle finger, etc. This is a good way to regulate in many situations!

69,i4hfylg,t3_u24y23,t3_u24y23,GREAT_SCOTCH,Parenting,"An interesting fact I learned is that it sometimes takes up to 10 seconds for a toddler or young child to register your words and come up with a response - especially if they're engaged in something and need to shift their focus before they can process what you've said.  I wonder if you're insisting on a response (verbally or non-verbally) earlier than that, and that is why the response you're getting is ""what?"" as a filler before the real response comes.  I've read that when getting a young child's attention it's best to get down on their level, say their name (and maybe touch their shoulder if saying their name doesn't work), wait for them to look at you, and then ask the question.  And then allow that space for them to come up with an answer.  Their brains just don't process verbal stuff quite as fast as adult brains.  On one podcast I was listening to, the expert said that when her kids were toddlers she would ask a question and then literally count to ten in her head before saying anything else to keep from trying to rush them, since it can feel like a REALLY long time for us.  If in there you get a what, just continue to wait.  Hopefully she will stop feeling the need for the instant response and drop it if you're consistently allowing time for her answers.

As far as dealing with this for now, if it was me I would  teach her to say ""pardon"", because that's much less grating to me than ""what"" or ""huh"".

Possibilities 1) she is developing speech normally but is frustrated by your demands that she speak.  Our speech is one of the most powerful things we have; she‚Äôs communicating to you that she won‚Äôt be pushed into using her voice. 2) she has a speech delay that does not allow her to consistently use speech sounds.  This could be a TON of different speech disorders, so she may need evaluation by a professional.  My son has a form of apraxia that is called an oral motor planning delay.  He would jibber jabber with the best of them but could never repeat words. There was a delay in how his brain controlled his oral motor muscles. And sometimes we would hear spontaneous speech ‚Äúoutside!‚Äù but he would never use it again.  Imagine if I had just kept insisting that he knew the word ‚Äúoutside‚Äù and pestered him nonstop to use it.  He would definitely start having meltdowns.  His little brain and mouth simply couldn‚Äôt.  He‚Äôs been in speech therapy since 20 months and is now 4 years; the progress has been amazing compared to where he was, but still incredibly slow compared to his peers.  We‚Äôre hoping that he‚Äôs just caught up enough to attend kindergarten with his peers. 

Just talk to her normally - no more sounding things out for her, or emphasizing first syllables like ‚Äúwaaaaa‚Äù for water. That‚Äôs not how kids learn to talk.

As a dad who was very involved in the pregnancy stage and has been a very inolved father, if my wife would have come to me about it, I would have struggled and here's why. 

During my wife's pregnancy we took second and third seat once people found out. Everything was about the baby, everything. Second, everything was about my wife and how she was doing, holding up, they wanted every aspect. Me, I really felt like a thrid wheel at times to the general public. My wife and I were close, we had discussions on the future, made decisions on what to buy, I made doctors apointments, etc. etc. I was always asked what I was doing for my wife and baby, never asked how I was doing. Again, I felt like a complete thrid wheel. So, the last name matching mine felt like I had some involvement in this. Now, based on your post your experence isn't matching ours in terms of being involved, but the idea of being removed even more would have been really rough. 

I don't know if it is the same where you live, but last names do generally match the fathers. When they don't, there is often a question of who the father is, so there can be some social pressure there as well. 

You're right, marrage is supposed to be a partnership where you can both come to the table. However when both won't budge, it makes serious decisions that much harder becuase one has to give.

An attorney will be expensive, but sometimes worth it. The only reason why I hired an attorney was because my state did not do a great job of finding him to get child support. This is not legal advice, but from experience. Usually the courts will have both parents go through mediation before taking it to court. I'm in CO, and it's an equal state, no parent gets more than other unless it has been proven a parent is unfit, which there has be recorded history. I would make sure to note and keep any correspondence with your ex as well. In the end, we ended up in mediation and it turned out far better than I thought it would. The best part is having it on paper and it's clear cut, no more using our daughter as leverage. 

Having bad days does not make you unfit, acknowledging it makes you stronger. As moms, we have so much pressure to be a ""good"" mom. But what is the definition of a good mom??

Some will need a little help - and that‚Äôs it‚Äôs own challenge - but it‚Äôs pure dumb luck and parents should never be made to feel bad for the situation they‚Äôre in. 

My sister and I both have boys about 2 weeks apart that are nearly 2yo. Our son has been really advanced with his language (e.g. he can ask for things politely, sing full songs like abcs and 5 little ducks, talk-along with books). My sisters son is way ahead of our kid physically (e.g. a country mile ahead with running, football and throwing), but has a speech delay - he‚Äôs got about 5-10 words and they‚Äôre all pretty mumbly. 

My mum can‚Äôt stop herself and compares the two at every opportunity. It‚Äôs not nice and it‚Äôs not fair, it‚Äôs just the way things are. I try and shut it down every time and reiterate that it‚Äôs not a competition, but she still does it.",1649792755
89,i4gyi31,t3_u26fyc,t3_u26fyc,MysticJAC10,Parenting,"&gt;I think a lot of the other kids think she doesn't care because she doesn't speak up.

It's a challenging issue for sure, and it sounds like you are doing all the right things.  As you said above, that's kind of the difficult thing in so many available social circles when you're the quiet kid.  Introversion and shyness get mistaken for aloofness and judgment, especially by other insecure people who take a more active/aggressive approach to dealing with their own fears of rejection and alienation.

I'll admit that my daughter isn't there yet, but honestly I wasn't too far off from your daughter in circumstances, and things didn't really improve for me until I got to college.  And, really, things only got better there because it provided a rather good reset button for my social situation, and I started therapy there which helped considerably.  I know professional help is the ""easy"" answer in these situations, so I'll spare you the step of suggesting it as I'm sure it's crossed your mind.  However, I will say that I was so against the extremes of being mean, gossipy, or judgmental that I was honestly living at the other extreme in having no sense of my own opinions or motivations in anything.  I mean, I had opinions and motivations, but the true ones would never be shared and the expressed ones could change to suit whatever person I happened to be around.  It's hard thing at her age to grasp, and it's hard thing to express to your child who you want to be kind, but there are many times and places where you need to be firm, not mean.  Banter, not gossip. Be opinionated, not judgmental.

Again, that's not to say she needs to make friends with mean kids or anything.  It's more the frustrating reality that the way to break out of the vicious cycle of rejection and not taking social risks is to break out of the vicious cycle by enduring rejection and taking social risks.  Just as I started in the safety of my counselor's office and moved outward towards friends and family, she might benefit from be giving more platforms in your home to share her raw opinions on stuff.  Ask her and push on her.  Find out what makes her angry.  Find out what gets her really fired up and loud.  Find out what opinions mean more to her to express than to keep hidden away out of desire to be safe.  Follow where that passion and aggression might lead her.  I honestly found I had been so conflict-averse for so long that I really needed to discover that fire inside myself for the first time and recognize how much I liked it burning, how it was comparable to the warmth of feeling safe and I didn't need to be afraid to engage it.  Something in finding that inner fire kind of made everything else fall into place with other relationships.

That's just one avenue to consider.",1649792683

Anyway after that perfectly rational conversation someone chose to stop me and say I should have stuck to my guns and shown kid that if I said pancakes I meant pancakes and he couldn't whine his way into waffles.

Like what no who cares? I had no logical, important reason for pancakes - it's not like he asked for donuts instead (yes I know frozen mini pancakes are not nutritionally great).  The waffles *were* comparable.  When I have a good reason, and/or it is important, I do stick to my guns.  Also, he didn't whine.  He literally asked politely.

That can lead to more wobbling and falling (ie., more potential for injury). 

My fianc√© and I made the decision together to opt not to put our son in shoes unless absolutely necessary (if it's cold, I'm not letting his little baby toes suffer) after a long chat with a podiatrist. Every kid is different, and it's not a decision everyone agrees with. 

However, our son began walking at 10 months and has really learned to navigate different types of environments, giving him a stronger sense of balance and helping him learn quickly how to deal with different inclines/declines, his ability to climb, and really stimulates his sensory exploration because he can run his feet and toes over all kinds of new things! 

Other than my mom and dad (who also didn't put me in shoes until I was like, four), the other grandparents and the great grandparents seem to be annoyed with our decision, and refuse to respect it by passive aggressively buying him shoes as often as possible, and then pointing out he isn't wearing them when we send videos of him playing.

I didn't get my ears pierced until I was 3, and I have the memory of it. Prior to, I'd wear clip-ons on the daily and wanted my ears pierced so badly. My mom had 5 other small children to tend to so piercing my ears wasn't a priority. When I finally cried enough at 3 to get them, we went to get them pierced. I still remember the internal struggle of so badly wanting the piercings, but also being terrified of the process. I ran around the store for an hour crying bc it was such a dilemma. When my daughter was born, I didn't want her to have the same struggle. I waited until she was 1 to pierce them. She cried for 10 seconds and then acted like nothing ever happened. She's 5 now and has had an array of earrings which she uses to accessorize with. She LOVES her piercings but is also absolutely terrified of needles. I'm happy I made the decision to pierce her early. But, I can see how this may not be the case for others from a different culture. I see many white girls even around 10 that dont yet have piercings. That would be unheard of in our culture",1649789527

Like even if I don't help with the actual computation or methods at all, just me sitting by his side making him slow down has a huge impact on how he'll do on a math worksheet or something.  He is either bored and rushing through something, or so excited about it that he's eager to do the next question too.  

I think this matters because in 3rd grade, because the fundamentals are still so easy for him that he can make these mistakes and still get decent grades.  I don't particularly care about his grades in 3rd grade, but he cares.  Also, more importantly, as the work gets more complicated this rushing and missing subtle parts of the question, will make it harder to master the material.

Rather than putting your emphasis on OUTCOME (rewarding 100's and no that is NOT a good idea), put your emphasis on process.  Some of the process stuff my teacher works on with my kid in class and has encouraged us to use/reinforce at home-

* Read a problem once, then read it AGAIN and circle key words,
* Double check work by comparing your process with the key words.  This might look like, you circled ""total"" because the question is like how many widgets the class collected in total, but you have a ""-"" in your problem showing you subtracted.  This is not always a sign you are wrong, but is a sign you should double check.
* Use something like a cut down piece of cardstock to cover other problems/questions, so that he is only looking at 1 question at a time.
* Sometimes I have him write lines separating the problems into grids, because for awhile if question 1 was adding then he'd miss that question 2 was subtracting.  He'd add correctly, but he had been supposed to subtract.  'Crossing a line' meant potentially new instructions.
* Put a check mark if you did the question, double checked it and are happy with your answer.  Circle the number if you need to go back to it.  Then at the end, go through and look for those circles.

When a math test is coming up, I like to sit with my kid and watch him work.  I like to have him narrate what he's doing - I encourage him to 'teach me how to solve this question' and I pay attention to what steps he's missing and how we can teach him from the perspective not of solving that particular problem, computationally, but of solving the problem of accurately identifying what the problem IS.",1649789449

Facilitate his emotional regulation helping him know you understand that it sucks and to find a solution as a team for how to fix it.

Like the cookie issue : "" oh no. Your cookie is broken and that makes you feel sad. I would feel sad too. Would you like me to listen, to give you a hug or to help?""

Ever since he was about 4/5 months old, my son would get about 30 minutes of play all by himself (well... alone to HIM...our house has an open floor plan so I can watch him from the other room). He'd entertain himself, and then when he started getting cranky with his toys or his time alone, I'd come back and play with him. Now that he's 16 months, depending on how excited he is by something, he can play for up to 45 minutes uninterrupted on his own. Gives me a bit of a break.

2. I sit on the floor with him now. He seems to like being on the same level and leaves me alone a little longer when I'm eye level. I also overexaggerate love and cuddles sometimes. So like, he'll go play, then run over to me for my attention, and I go BANANAS. Hugs, cuddles, smooches, tickles, I attach myself to him like a friggin octopus. He laughs, soaks up the attention, then runs off to play some more. I repeat as needed when he comes back. 

Both of these get me the break I need. I'll be honest: I am NOT a touchy feely person, even before kids. I don't particularly like being cuddled, or touched much so when my son started clinging to me, it honestly made me hate being touched even more. Like, by the end of the day, I could barely stand my fianc√©'s hug or kiss when he walked through the door. It was 100% not him, I was just so completely overtaxed with being groped at for 10 hours a day that I was wildly overstimulated and I couldn't wind down. Independent play and being overly affectionate when my son DOES come looking for attention have both given me some space to be able to breathe throughout the day.",1649788241

89,i4gmowq,t3_u1vxa8,t3_u1vxa8,archmama1361,Parenting,"You are definitely not a bad mom. I think no mom wants to hear their child wail and scream. It's heartbreaking. However, if you want them to sleep the night without you then you may have to suffer through a few nights of crying (probably by everyone) and break the habit. If you don't feel comfortable, which is totally fine, then you may have to accept the wakeups and provide the comfort until your kids are emotionally ready to let it go. 

The Hatch is meaningless unless you tell your child you are not coming in until that light turns blue. That maybe could benefit your older one too? If they want to come into your bed, then maybe offer that only if they come in when the lights turn blue. 

Also, do you have a video monitor? Can you talk to them through it? Maybe they just need the comfort of knowing you are ""there"" without you physically being in there. Or at least you can use that as a starting point and then fade you at completely. 

My only other thought is the quality of their naps. You say they go to preschool so I'm wondering if they nap there. If my kid misses a nap or sleeps like shit, a nighttime wake up is usually in my future. Maybe they aren't napping enough which is affecting nighttime sleep. 

You should also not be taking 95% of the wakeups. Your partner needs to get on board with helping you. My husband sleeps through everything but I'll wake him up even if I've already been awake because he needs to join in the misery too.

4,i4glsje,t3_u1j7hf,t3_u1j7hf,Honeybee3674,Parenting,"Honestly, I would wonder if there was some kind of trauma  or internal struggle you don't know about, possibly related to the youth pastor leaving, and not being able to be in contact with that person. This sounds deeper than just having a mentor you really clicked with moving away.

Was the leaving sudden? Are church leaders not talking about why he left? Was there anything hushed over about his departure?

Very often, if there is inappropriate behavior on behalf of a youth pastor, it is covered up. This can happen in ANY church, school, community group, literally anywhere adults have contact with kids. The nicest, most outwardly wonderfully, devout-seeming people can groom young people. Something might not have even happened with your child, but he might know suspect or have learned something about the youth pastor that disillusioned him.

On the other hand, it could be the youth pastor being ostracized for something he can't help, (like being gay?), despite having only healthy and appropriate relationships with the youth. Possibly your own child might be wrestling with gender/sexual identity issues and the youth pastor was someone he felt safe confiding in (even if youth pastor is cis/hetero, youth pastor might have a more tolerant/acceptance attitude or viewpoint).

Obviously I don't know you or the situation, but as a teacher of teenagers, these are some of the types of factors that come to mind as possibilities given your description. It could also just be rebellion of too-strict rules or a search for independence, but you pointing out the youth pastor's leaving was the catalyst for out of character behavior, and not communicating with you like he did before, is what throws up some potential red flags in my mind.

As parents we can have the most loving/close relationships, and our teens can still struggle with something they really don't feel they can tell us because they don't want to worry us further, don't want to ""cause"" conflict, or they don't want to be rejected by us.",1649787848

Ear piercing is nothing like that. If a child is afraid and screaming before an ear piercing, then I would hope a parent would be understanding and not go through with it. That's being a decent parent and knowing their children. The same goes for kids who are forced to ride rollercoasters. I made my daughter ride some rides and she said no on a few out of fear but I knew they weren't scary and she could handle it. She ended up loving them. Some of the rides she wanted to go on, she would suddenly be shaking and crying so we would leave before the ride started. Parents can decide what risks they want to take.

Summer between frosh and sophomore year is when it started going downhill.  Lockdown came spring of sophomore year and it was a nightmare.  Got courts involved, he straightened out a little, quit playing baseball, dropped bad crowd for awhile.  

Fast forward to senior year, now, last semester as we speak.  Barely attends school, when he does, does nothing, smokes weed, vapes, disrespectful, lies, hangs out with wrong crowd again.  Trust me when I say we have done everything. But, there are hardly any resources, school basically says he needs 1 class to graduate, they don't want him back so some how he will sneak by, against me wishes, courts cannot help anymore since he's 17, cops shrug their shoulders, I feel absolutely lost and defeated.

He turns 18 in Sept.  So my plan is this.  If you can afford to buy weed, vapes and the like, you can afford your own phone bill, you can pay for your car insurance, repairs, any and all clothes are on you.  And if you continue to smoke weed, sorry bud, you cannot live here.  

I've watched him waste the last 3 years of his life all the while getting enjoyment over tormenting us, laughing at us, calling us every name in the book.  And I'm not doing it anymore.  By law, I cannot legally evict him til 18.  Unfortunately I do not deserve what he has put us through and I sick of him wasting his life at out expense. 

And for those who think weed isn't a ""big deal"", I've seen the destruction 1st hand with him. I'm not anti weed but when teens start abusing it at a young age and the THC levels in vapes, sorry, they become dependent on it.  Any legal adult has the choice which I fully support.

They were angry and needed to get it out, but any attempt to calm them down - by empathizing, trying logic, threatening punishment (not appropriate and not what she'd do anyway) - just amplified the anger.

67,i4gjfhl,t3_u21bh2,t3_u21bh2,Feyloh,Parenting,"So funny story about confidence, my daughter attends two preschools. One is 5 half days at a Montessori school and the other is two afternoons at the public preschool school where the class is designed around speech therapy.

The programs have many similarities, same class sizes, circle time, tables, etc. At one program she is encouraged and thrives, at the other they treat her like she is incapable. One program has recognized that she doesn't do well with quizzing but if they modify the question she not only demonstrates the knowledge of what they are asking but an even greater understanding. The other is solely quizzed based.

In one program, she is moving up to preK just before she turns 4. The other, well they seemed to have given up. We had open houses recently and the quality of work at one place over the other was very stark. At one place her pictures are fairly good for a 3.5y, she writes her name on her work, does larger puzzles, etc. At the other place, her work was unrecognizable. It was bad.

Sadly her confidence is completely different too. One place she comes home saying she can't do things or she can't speak right. The other place she comes home excited and asks more questions and tells me what she learned and speaks more clearly.

So, OP confidence is key but you already know that. Let her know progress not perfection is the goal. Praise things she's good at even if it's not related to letters. Make mistakes in front of her and show her how you handle it. I did this with speech for my daughter. I'd mispronounce a word that she knew and had her correct me. So I'd say Pa-no instead of PI-A-NO. She would correct me and I'd say ""oh you're right, it's piano. You're so good at this. Piano, I'll keep working on that!"". Encourage curiosity and independence. Give her chores and tasks that she can do with a few that are a little hard. Finally, you need the teacher on board too. I've seen the drastic difference between a good teacher and a bad one.

As far as learning letters and sounds, we play lots of Zingo, Super Words, Sequence Letters. We do a letter of the week at home. I know some people aren't fond of that approach but it's working well for my 3.5y and my 2y is even picking up on letter recognition. We're doing F this work. So we're cooking with Flour and making Fajitas. We're planting Flowers and using Fertilizer. Fish crafts, Flag (I'm teaching the pledge since she already does it I'm class), we're doing a puppet show on Friday with a Frog and Fox Finger puppet. We use magnet letters to spell words (we have 4 sets of Curious Columbus magnets which also come with object magnets. We have food, animals, dinos, and the  random objects one). I also have dry erase boards all over the house. I used them pre-kids for work and chore lists but now I also spell out words. My daughter is a visual learner, so seeing letters helps more than hearing the sound. Reading helps too of course. My 3.5y loves poetry like Ogden Nash and Shel Silverstine. My 3.5y also likes workbooks but not all children are into that. [Teachers Pay Teachers](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwxtSSBhDYARIsAEn0thQLnZIrKUmi0cqtrJW9C_19cYMkJz8-3x8COEdWKDlObTBGQEc8eSYaAgRtEALw_wcB) also has tons of learning activities for purchase. Most of it is digital items that you download and print yourself but some of it is solely digital that you can use on a tablet.

I'm a huge supporter of interdisciplinary teaching such as teaching math through cooking or teaching letters with playdoh, etc. Children tend to be good at this already but as they get older, schools tend to separate and specialize subjects. So I think it's best to mix letters and blending with something else, anything that your child already enjoys or is even curious about.",1649786960

Most people seem better equipped or geared to solve problems over validate feelings.  It's much easier and straightforward to tell you about some special one-way straws and sippy cups they got on Amazon to resolve the backwash issue than commiserate with you on the matter.  A practical answer doesn't require them to be vulnerable with you, possibly examining their own senses of frustration and aggravation in the course of relating to your feelings.  Some parents, maybe even many parents, struggle with the shame and arises out of that honesty.  

The problem is that not all situations have a practical answer to them.  So many parenting challenges are just things you have to live through and endure, which puts the advisor in a crouch because with nothing pragmatic to share, they are left only to share their own vulnerable experience...or put up a wall to suggest everything was fine and you should appreciate this time.
